1
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,977
<i>Previously on</i> The Institute...

2
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,017
We are in trouble, and we
need your help right now.

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,727
Alright. If you had seen
what was on that drive...

4
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,227
The drive you left in
the Chief's pocket,

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,810
the one that would
prove everything!

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,567
<i>He's not strong enough
to talk back to me.</i>

7
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,567
<i>But me, I'm strong.</i>

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,947
<i>I'm a lot stronger
than they know.</i>

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,287
At the moment, we need
him, so we Gork him.

10
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,627
He conducts tonight, goes
straight to Recovery.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,707
He can power The
Hum indefinitely.

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,007
Hey! Let her go now! Let
her go right now, man!

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,347
You're using us to
commit the perfect crime,

14
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,017
murders with no
physical evidence.

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,437
I'm sure you've seen by now
Luke has some rare abilities,

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,437
low level, but there's
another ability

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,527
more rare, more
important, precognition.

18
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,577
Like telling the future?

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,037
The PC track.

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,197
It's bullshit. It's...
It's fucking bullshit.

21
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,960
Well, what would you
do? What would you do?

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,997
What would you do
to save the world?

You know what?

40
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,987
I want to hear you give
that long-ass speech

41
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,740
to the real FBI,
see what they say.

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,547
Whoa, whoa.

43
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,210
Luke, are you okay?

44
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,180
So, this is Sparkler
Night, Avester.

45
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,970
These can be tough.

46
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,557
<i>I know what they are.
Luke explained it to me.</i>

47
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,227
<i>What did he say?</i>

48
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,567
<i>There aren't going to be
any more Sparkler Nights.</i>

49
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,477
You've been talking to him?

50
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,237
<i>A little. He's
sometimes hard to hear.</i>

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,440
-<i>He's sometimes hard...</i>
-Luke, are you okay?

52
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,077
I see we're all
eager to get going.

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,537
Avery Dixon will be
our conductor tonight.

54
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,377
Uh, there...

55
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,507
Avery gets to go home early.

56
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,630
Lucky boy.

57
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,850
Thank you all for
your cooperation.

58
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,597
Uh, this is an easy job, Avery.

59
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,937
Just drive the car off the road,

60
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,727
like falling off a bike.

61
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,437
That's way stronger
than normal, right?

62
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,280
I predicted it would be
with Dixon conducting.

63
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,570
Good thing I insisted
on doing this now.

64
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,807
<i>I wish Luke were here.</i>

65
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,640
<i>He told me how to do all this.</i>

66
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,020
Luke.

67
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,527
There are levers.

68
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,657
Avery, just use the
levers like I taught you.

69
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,077
<i>Luke, I see the levers.</i>

70
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,037
<i>No more Movie Nights.
No more Sparkler Nights.</i>

71
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,377
<i>Remember when Luke said there
would be a time to fight?</i>

72
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,537
<i>Hell yeah.</i>

73
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,920
<i>Form a circle.</i>

74
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,227
Tony, what... what
the hell is this?

75
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,437
They're spiking early.

76
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,647
Uh, oh, don't!

77
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,530
You'll break the connection.
We're at Key Hole.

78
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,517
<i>Now! Avery, now.</i>

79
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,477
<i>Just think of the sparklers.
Just think of the sparklers.</i>

80
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,020
<i>Think of the sparkler.</i>

81
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,987
<i>Think of the sparkler.</i>

82
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,320
<i>Think of the sparkler.</i>

83
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,157
<i>Think of the sparkler.</i>

84
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,060
Why aren't they triggering?

85
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,597
The sparklers!

86
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,057
It was supposed to crash!

87
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,567
-<i>Hello?</i>
<i>-Where are you?</i>

88
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,290
Tony, break this! Stop them!

89
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,757
<i>Hey, Tony.</i>

90
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,927
<i>Ever wonder how it tastes?</i>

91
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,970
Come on.

92
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,677
Are you okay? You're okay?

93
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,467
-Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.
-Yeah? You're good?

94
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,137
Yeah.

95
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,477
-You okay?
-Yeah. Are you?

96
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,478
Yeah.

97
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,437
Come on, Sha.

98
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,857
Aren't we getting out?

99
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,817
Luke said first we'd
need more power.

100
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,070
We're gonna get them out.

101
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,830
You okay, pal?

102
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,830
Back with us?

103
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,830
Fine.

104
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,757
Even with everything
that's going on,

105
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,467
you're still running missions.

106
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,887
You're saving the world,

107
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,760
you don't get to wait
till it's convenient.

108
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,857
No. No.

109
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,647
We need to get him to the feds
and get you to a hospital.

110
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,570
Why don't you want us to
know about the others?

111
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,070
-The others?
-The other Institutes.

112
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,570
I don't know what
you're talking about.

113
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,120
You guys fucked up.

114
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,137
Attention.

115
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,177
This is not a drill.

116
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,347
Lockdown. Lockdown!

117
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,390
This is not a drill.

118
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,437
Shit. Shit.

119
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,480
Shit! Shit! Shit!

120
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,947
You know what's back there?

121
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,907
I think I always saw them,

122
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,367
but I didn't understand
what they were

123
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,077
until Luke told me.

124
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,247
What who were?

125
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,510
Okay. Okay.

126
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,220
Let's just...

127
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Yeah.

128
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,910
-Holy shit!
-What?

129
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,257
<i>Luke said they're the battery.</i>

130
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,170
<i>We can use their power.</i>

131
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,130
Let's go.

132
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,847
Goddamn.

133
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,967
Zeke, shut down the
power to Back Half.

134
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,637
-What?
-The tunnel, shut it down now.

135
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,477
Uh, yes, sir. I can try.
We've never really done this.

136
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,940
Just do it.

137
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,207
-Shit.
-What's going on?

138
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,587
-I don't know.
-Okay. Let's go.

139
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,040
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Yeah, okay.

140
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,430
Got you.

141
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,227
We're stronger together.

142
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,990
Bust that lock, Avester.

143
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,160
It's not locked.

144
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,080
It's dead.

145
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,617
We've managed to confine
them to the tunnel.

146
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,540
Yes, sir. Glad I
could kill the power.

147
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,797
Of course, this is only
a temporary measure.

148
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,377
Suppose we needed,

149
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,217
to use an unjustly
vilified phrase,

150
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,217
a final solution
concerning those residents.

151
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,347
Are you asking if you
could make them inert?

152
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,180
Make safe.

153
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,477
Let's say I am.

154
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,857
Easiest thing in the world, sir.

155
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,317
You get some bleach,
some toilet bowl cleaner.

156
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,237
Housekeeping's got tons of both.

157
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,067
Mix 'em up, right ratios.

158
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,450
Hey, presto. You've
got chlorine gas.

159
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,077
Dump a few buckets of that stuff
into the tunnel intake ducts.

160
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,787
Then let's get the
ingredients ready

161
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,460
and stand by.

162
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,050
Just a contingency,
you understand.

163
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,460
Yes, sir.

164
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,430
Stay there.

165
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,820
Hope you're taking this in.

166
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,947
All the trees,

167
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,657
the green, the air.

168
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,527
You're gonna want
to remember this

169
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,450
when it all turns to ash.

170
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,827
I don't expect the
kids to get it.

171
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,627
I don't even really
expect most adults...

172
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,167
-Just stop it.
-...to understand.

173
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,587
-Just shut up, alright? No.
-But you should.

174
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,467
Just shut your fucking mouth!

175
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,467
Do you know how much
evil is done by people

176
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,547
in the name of saving the world?

177
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,677
We <i>are</i> saving the world.

178
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,760
No. No. You're killing children.

179
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,437
A few.

180
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,477
-Few. Few.
-Who die heroes.

181
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,850
-Few.
-And opposed to what?

182
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,647
Dying alongside the rest of us?

183
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,397
Watching everyone
they love burn,

184
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,657
the skin peeling off...

185
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,157
-Shh.
-...like rags.

186
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,527
No. A handful of kids
to prevent all of that.

187
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,657
You don't think that's worth it?

188
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,117
-No.
-You don't?

189
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,327
You don't think that's worth it?

190
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,457
-No, I don't.
-Well, that's insane.

191
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,940
-You're insane.
-Yeah, I'm insane.

192
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,467
Hey, you got it all wrong.

193
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,880
Yeah? Then I'm glad
to disappoint you.

194
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,807
Luke's trying to
tell me something,

195
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,730
but it's too far.

196
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,027
I can't hear him.

197
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,697
-Can he hear you?
-I don't know.

198
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,280
We better fucking hope so.

199
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,037
<i>Luke? Can you hear me?</i>

200
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
Come on, Luke.

201
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,727
Stop! Stop. Stop.

202
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,187
-What? What? Why?
-We need to go back.

203
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,437
-We need to go back.
-Luke, we have

204
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,727
to get you to the FBI.
The sooner we do...

205
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,437
-No. There's no time for that.
-Hey!

206
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,067
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! Luke!
-Hey!

207
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,987
We don't have time for that now,
okay? They still have a chance,

208
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,237
-but we need more power.
-Luke!

209
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,697
And Avery needs to
answer that Big Phone,

210
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,537
and he can't... he can't
do that on his own.

211
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,827
I've been trying to tell him,
but my TP's not strong enough

212
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,827
to hold the connection.

213
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,290
So I need to get close.

214
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,497
I need to go back.

215
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,757
Everything you did to get
out, now you wanna go back in?

216
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,007
My friends are trapped,

217
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,967
and Stackhouse is
going to kill them.

218
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,217
-How can you know that?
-Because I just do, okay?

219
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,137
Alright. Well,
here's what we know.

220
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,557
Going back there is suicide.

221
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,967
We need to get to
the outside world

222
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,887
as fast as possible, ride
back with the cavalry.

223
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,097
-No.
-Come on. You're a smart kid.

224
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,767
-You know I'm right.
-That'll take too long, okay?

225
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,017
If there's a chance
to save them,

226
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,357
then it's now, okay?

227
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,150
-We need to get help.
-Luke! Luke! Look.

228
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,857
I don't know what the right
thing to do here is, man,

229
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,490
but I know that I believe you.

230
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,537
So whatever you wanna
do, whatever you decide,

231
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,287
as long as I am
fucking breathing,

232
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,497
I promise that I will do

233
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,707
whatever it takes
to make it happen...

234
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,837
Tim, you can't
make that his call.

235
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,500
-He's just a kid.
-Why not?

236
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,260
It's the grown-ups
who fucked it all up.

237
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,547
Yeah.

238
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,227
We've had a situation here.

239
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,437
Happily, I've got it contained.

240
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,317
Hope you can say the same thing.

241
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
No such luck.

242
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,197
Mr. Jamieson.

243
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,157
<i>Mr. Stackhouse.</i>

244
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,987
My colleague, the one

245
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,660
<i>that phone belongs
to, is she alive?</i>

246
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,037
-I'm here, Trevor.
-Thank God.

247
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,037
And the Ellis boy, is
he with you as well?

248
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,497
I'm here.

249
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,877
I assume your friends
have kept you abreast

250
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,340
of the spot they're in.

251
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,837
-They have.
-Good.

252
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,590
That makes this
conversation simple.

253
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,227
You know about chlorine gas.

254
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,440
<i>Reacts with water and
makes hydrochloric acid.</i>

255
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,187
Think about all the moisture
that coats your throat,

256
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,317
your lungs.

257
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,657
<i>Now imagine how it would feel</i>

258
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,910
<i>if it all turns to
acid inside of you.</i>

259
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,747
I want you here, Luke.

260
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,750
Otherwise, that's how
your friends will die.

261
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,587
<i>Avery.</i>

262
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,337
<i>Nicky.</i>

263
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,297
<i>Kalisha.</i>

264
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,047
And if I do come
back, then what?

265
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,467
You'll wipe their
memories as usual

266
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,847
<i>and agree to send them home?</i>

267
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:13,060
I know about the
chimneys, Mr. Stackhouse.

268
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,727
They die anyway.

269
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,477
<i>Not necessarily.</i>

270
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,447
There's an area of our work

271
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,657
that doesn't require
damaging the subjects.

272
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,070
Right. Precognition.

273
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,997
Ms. Sigsby has been talkative.

274
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,867
<i>What else has she told you?</i>

275
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,877
She told us there's only
a handful of precogs

276
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,337
that have ever been discovered.

277
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,797
What are you saying,

278
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,587
<i>that my friends are
all worthy candidates?</i>

279
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,550
No. You're the only
precog of the bunch.

280
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,177
Then I don't understand.

281
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,887
Did Ms. Sigsby happen to
tell you how PCs are treated?

282
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,060
<i>Like kings.</i>

283
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,977
Like gods.

284
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,487
So you think if you promise
to treat me like a god

285
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,607
that I'll be willing to
let you use up my friends?

286
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,117
I would imagine,

287
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,157
for a genuine PC,

288
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,410
<i>we could make some
accommodation.</i>

289
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,247
We have a deal, Mr. Stackhouse,

290
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,627
and just remember, if you
do anything to my friends,

291
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,927
I will know.

292
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,677
And you won't see me again

293
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,507
<i>until you watch
me on</i> 60 Minutes.

294
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,347
You have my word.

295
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,557
You know it's a trap.

296
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,810
Of course it's a trap.

297
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,230
I'm not coming <i>to</i> him.

298
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,280
<i>We</i> are coming <i>for</i> him.

299
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:05,127
Is she... Is Ms. Sigsby dead?

300
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,670
Why do you ask?

301
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,467
I've never seen anyone
sit in her seat before.

302
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,387
Not dead. Certainly
incapacitated.

303
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,347
Frankly, she's been
tested and failed.

304
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,347
She's no longer
mission-critical.

305
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,607
<i>Mr. Stackhouse?</i>

306
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,357
Yeah?

307
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,857
<i>-Where are we?</i>
-Mixed an abundance.

308
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,027
Figured you'd want to
have enough to be sure.

309
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,567
Industrial disinfectant
from Housekeeping,

310
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,067
<i>stronger than bleach,</i>

311
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,867
<i>mixed with a product
called Micro Sterile.</i>

312
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,287
<i>Contains nitric and
phosphoric acid.</i>

313
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,287
Should be enough to
sweep the tunnel clean

314
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,460
of anything organic,
even the microbes.

315
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,417
<i>You might wanna let
any remaining personnel</i>

316
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,167
<i>in Back Half know</i>

317
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,297
<i>it's gonna be
extremely fragrant.</i>

318
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,927
Good. Stand by and
wait for my signal.

319
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,547
Uh, Fellowes,

320
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,927
the children may attempt
to influence you.

321
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,557
<i>Make sure you ignore all
distracting thoughts.</i>

322
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,810
I always do, sir.

323
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,317
Why am I here?

324
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,407
I should be prepping the labs

325
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,157
for the burn,
preserving my data.

326
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,120
You and I have a
phone call to make.

327
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,178
<i>Avery...</i>

328
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,257
<i>Avery...</i>

329
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,677
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

330
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,227
Luke's on his way.

331
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,677
He's got something
he needs to tell me.

332
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,437
I can feel him trying.

333
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,017
Tell him to hurry. I can feel...

334
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,777
-I know.
-I can feel it, too.

335
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,567
You're in my head?

336
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,447
Uh, yeah, but not going through
your mental underwear drawer.

337
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,447
<i>We're all in each
other's heads now.</i>

338
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,240
<i>Avery...</i>

339
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,577
What's the Big Phone?

340
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,580
Yeah. Why am I thinking that?

341
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,127
I don't know.

342
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,337
It's part of what Luke's
trying to tell us.

343
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,707
He wants us to work together,

344
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,550
but I don't know what
the Big Phone is.

345
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,510
Big Phone.

346
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,137
Big Phone.

347
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,227
Not much of a plan.

348
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,590
Well, it's what
we have time for.

349
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,447
That day at the Westfield mall,

350
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,237
woman runs out,

351
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,447
tells you there's
a guy with a gun.

352
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,410
You remember what you
thought in that moment?

353
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,287
Something like that there's,
uh... there's your life before

354
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,370
and life after.

355
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,090
Honestly, I didn't
stop to think anything.

356
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,887
You wanna believe you
wouldn't think twice.

357
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,090
Chance to save some kids.

358
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,597
Bet everyone believes that

359
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,010
till it's time to
actually do it.

360
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,770
Okay. Slow down.
We're getting close.

361
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,200
We've got them. Inbound.

362
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,827
<i>One in front, two behind.</i>

363
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,707
<i>Looks like the night
knocker's driving.</i>

364
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,167
Copy that.

365
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,917
I really don't understand
why I need to be here.

366
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,797
I'm a scientist, not a soldier.

367
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,257
You need to be here, Doctor,

368
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,050
because I'm not letting
you out of my sight.

369
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,460
That's far enough.

370
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,800
You're injured.

371
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,007
-I'm fine.
-First things first.

372
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,467
Let Ms. Sigsby go.

373
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,807
How is that first? No.
Sigsby stays in the car

374
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,437
until I'm satisfied that
you're playing it straight.

375
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,807
And if you're not, Luke
puts a bullet in her head.

376
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,107
And believe me.

377
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,357
I've had to hold him
back several times.

378
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,237
How would you suggest we begin?

379
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,527
Give me those kids that
you're about to gas.

380
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,447
Come, come, Mr. Jamieson.

381
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,867
I can go back to the car, step
out. We can start this again.

382
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,827
Perhaps I should
speak with Mr. Ellis.

383
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,370
No. You talk to me.

384
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,337
Just in case you've
got a sniper.

385
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,127
<i>You gotta make some kind
of good-faith offer, man.</i>

386
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,710
<i>Let some kids go.</i>

387
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,877
<i>I'm fully prepared to do that.</i>

388
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,547
<i>Stop.</i>

389
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,267
<i>We have some children
ready for releas,</i>

390
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,890
<i>but what are you gonna
offer us in return?</i>

391
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,647
We're here, aren't we?

392
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,937
I think perhaps I should
talk to Luke myself.

393
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,487
Have him step out.

394
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,697
Not without some assurances.

395
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,617
<i>I have eyes on
Sigsby and Ellis.</i>

396
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,827
<i>Be advised, if we move
without neutralizing Ellis,</i>

397
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,287
<i>there's a significant likelihod</i>

398
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,197
<i>Sigsby will be
collateral damage.</i>

399
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,207
Understood.

400
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,497
So, Mr. Jamieson,

401
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,337
please accept our
gesture of good faith.

402
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
Now.

403
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,467
Move! Go!

404
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,427
Move in!

405
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,510
Let's go!

406
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,347
Cover!

407
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:49,727
This way! Get outta
the car now! Now!

408
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,728
Let's go.

409
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:52,607
Too bad, Stackhouse.

410
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,977
I really took you for
a trustworthy guy.

411
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:59,697
You can trust me, Mr. Jamieson,
to always do what's right.

412
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,780
Clear!

413
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,450
Welcome, Mr. Ellis.
We missed you.

414
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,867
Who's that?

415
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,077
Where's the boy?

416
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,887
-He's going back.
-Hands on your head!

417
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,217
To die with his friends?

418
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,137
He's going to tell Dixon
about the other sites.

419
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,557
He needs to get close enough.

420
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,097
You told him about
the other sites?

421
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,397
No, I fucking didn't tell
him about the other sites!

422
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,517
Un-cuff me!

423
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,227
If Dixon can figure out

424
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,937
how to connect to
the other sites,

425
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,777
he might be able to
conduct them all.

426
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,487
I thought you said
that wasn't possible.

427
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,407
It shouldn't be, but...

428
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,947
I begged you not to
give him the tank.

429
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,700
You gave him the tank?

430
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,617
-Drop the gas.
-No!

431
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,287
-You're all monsters.
-We're realists.

432
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,747
Conducting that much power,

433
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,507
there's no telling what
he'd be capable of.

434
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,087
We wipe out that crop,

435
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,630
we might as well gas
ourselves along with them.

436
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,390
With me.

437
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,140
Bring them.

438
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,897
-Where's your car?
-Behind the guardhouse.

439
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,317
We have to go to my office.

440
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,027
If any of those sites
are compromised,

441
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,447
he's gonna want to know.

442
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,737
We called him.

443
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,820
Them. Upstairs.

444
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,117
I'm...

445
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,867
How could anybody so smart

446
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,207
be so fucking stupid?

447
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,167
Stackhouse is gonna kill you.

448
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,377
He's gonna tell
any story he wants.

449
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,047
No. He needs me.

450
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:29,300
The program need... needs me.

451
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,260
Avery!

452
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,597
Avery!

453
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,770
Kalisha!

454
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,897
Anybody!

455
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,777
<i>Avery.</i>

456
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,527
-Luke's here.
-What? Where?

457
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,697
<i>Are you there?</i>

458
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,367
<i>I'm trying. I'm trying.</i>

459
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,367
<i>I am trying.</i>

460
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,450
<i>We need you.</i>

461
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,830
<i>They're out there.</i>

462
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,210
<i>You can feel them.</i>

463
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,670
<i>I know you can.</i>

464
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,530
<i>Get everyone up.</i>

465
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,567
Get everyone up.

466
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,067
When it happens,
we have to go fast.

467
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,527
When what happens?

468
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,747
<i>When you talk on
the Big Phone.</i>

469
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,327
-Okay. You good?
-Talk to who?

470
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,957
There you go. There you go.

471
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,627
Iris? Hey, can you hear me?

472
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,377
Okay. Um, let me get your legs.

473
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,257
Yup, yup. There we go.

474
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,340
Come on.

475
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,467
Wait. They have... They have
guns out there, Avester.

476
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,637
<i>Luke?</i>

477
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,840
<i>We're almost there.</i>

478
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,517
<i>It's time.</i>

479
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,180
<i>Avery, we have to
open the connection.</i>

480
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,877
Fabienne, how...

481
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,877
No. No. Uh, don't put my dad on.

482
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,170
Um...

483
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,130
I think I, uh, uh...

484
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,967
I have to go away for a while.

485
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,050
Um...

486
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,510
Look.

487
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,897
Try to keep him
away from the news,

488
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,150
and, uh...

489
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:18,027
if he asks about me, just, um,

490
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,447
just keep playing him
that... that message

491
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,070
I left on his birthday, okay?

492
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,080
Yep. No.

493
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,127
Thanks.

494
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,380
<i>First we make the sparkler.</i>

495
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,517
<i>First we make the sparkler.</i>

496
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,847
<i>And then we talk
on the Big Phone.</i>

497
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,430
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

498
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,187
<i>Do you hear us? Are you there?</i>

499
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,367
<i>Yes, we can hear you.</i>

500
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,037
<i>We can do it now.</i>

501
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,657
<i>Avery, we're connected.</i>

502
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,457
<i>We can do anything.</i>

503
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,587
We can do anything.

504
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,857
Everybody get back!
Everybody get back now!

505
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,477
-Okay! Okay! Go! Go! Go! Go!
-Get back!

506
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,357
No. It's dead, man.
I just tried it.

507
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,857
Luke, it's dead, man.

508
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,777
-No, it's not!
-This one's heavier.

509
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,567
No. We... we... we
can do this, okay?

510
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,650
I can help you.

511
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,347
Drop the gas.

512
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,227
Drop it now!

513
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,047
-Come on. Come on.
-Shit.

514
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,757
We don't have much time.

515
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,017
Avery, what are you
doing? Come on. Let's go.

516
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,437
<i>I'm the only one who can
keep the connection open.</i>

517
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,187
<i>They can't leave.</i>

518
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,317
<i>I have to stay with them
to see this through.</i>

519
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,897
-No.
<i>-To finish.</i>

520
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,777
-You can't! We're gonna stay!
-No! No!

521
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,907
We're gonna help you!
We're gonna stay! No!

522
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,157
<i>No!</i>

523
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,527
I'm sorry. It's not up to you.

524
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,747
Stop. No. Please! Avery, please!

525
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,407
<i>I'm sorry too.</i>

526
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,327
<i>Thanks for being my friends.
I loved having friends.</i>

527
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,037
Don't! Don't! Avery!

528
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:19,790
Whoa! Whoa!

529
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,047
George? George, come on.
We're getting out. Let's go.

530
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,887
-What? What?
-Go! Go!

531
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,670
-This way!
-Okay.

532
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,967
Here, you break a rule,

533
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,387
there's a grown-up consequence.

534
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,307
<i>Keep looking at the screen.</i>

535
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,147
If you look away once,
Tony will slap you.

536
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:29,357
If you look away a second
time, he'll shock you.

537
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,777
You know what they say
about the abyss, right?

538
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,870
You look into it, it
looks right back into you.

539
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,537
<i>Thanks for being my friends.</i>

540
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,117
<i>I loved having friends.</i>

541
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,977
Easy.

542
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,477
Keys. Now.

543
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,297
I need a burn team. Full clean.

544
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,597
Call me when they're on-site.

545
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,247
You're not gonna get me!

546
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,577
You're not gonna get me!

547
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,540
Hey!

548
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:58,837
Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa,
you're finally done your work!

549
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,177
Hide and Seek! Hide and Seek!

550
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,717
-I count? You hide.
-Yes!

551
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,807
Okay. Here we go. Let's go!

552
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:09,267
One! Two! Three! Four! Five!

553
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,727
No! That's my spot!

554
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:14,230
Six! Seven! Eight!

555
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,490
Avery.

556
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,120
He would've been Gorked.

557
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,617
And what he did,

558
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,710
maybe he thought
he was better off.

559
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,340
It would have stripped him.

560
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,640
Luke, now what?

561
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,690
Tim will know.

562
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,360
I hope.

563
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:00,317
You okay?

564
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,280
Yeah. You okay?

565
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:09,407
-Hi.
-Tim, these are my friends.

566
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:12,877
Uh, George, Kalisha,
Nicky, this is Tim.

567
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,287
Hi, everyone.

568
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,707
This is Wendy.

569
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:18,047
-Hey.
-Hi.

570
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,717
I told them that you'd
know what to do next.

571
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,967
First we gotta get out of here

572
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,257
before their
reinforcements arrive.

573
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,427
Let's go.

574
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,557
-Come on. Let's go.
-Come on.

575
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,640
Okay.

576
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,017
Then where do we go?

577
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,600
Don't worry about
it. I got a plan.

578
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,277
No, you don't.

579
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,730
Hey, get out of my head.

580
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,340
Come on now.

581
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,180
Thank you.
