00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,668
Now! Go! Go!

Okay, now, do yourself,

169
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,232
next to him, so I can keep
an eye on both of you.

00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,193
Do it right! I'm watching you.

Yes, sir.

183
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,398
We just may live
through this yet.

This is a bad idea.

187
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,700
It's a terrible idea. He's
too much of a wild card.

He's so strong in some
ways, I'd worry...

hours. If we can't make it,

there's gonna be

I need you to

until they reinforce you.

199

Yeah. I can do that.

Now what?

201
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,936
You wouldn't happen to have...

202
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,230
a safety pin or a
paperclip, would you?

00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,981
No.

204
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,192
Uh, there was a bit of a, uh...

205
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,069

The team will take care of that.

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,746
Okay. Uh...

211
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,248
Now, listen to me, Reynold...

00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,042
Um, okay.

213
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,921
I need you to lock
down that place

215

No one in. No one out.

I can't stress that enough.

217
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,471
Lock it down.

No one is going anywhere.

00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,392
Um... No, I understand.

220
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,893
Locked down. Yeah.

221
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,313

Yeah, I-I'll wait here.

Well, it's a bit

Apologies, Mr. Dixon,

331
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,602
but we have less than
two hours to Keyhole.

Avery.

344
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,099

00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,855
We should go.

-[Tim] Sure?
-Let's go.

I guess I don't need to
tell you what happens

00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,530

of jamming range,

Expunge us from the

355
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,630
Delete our birth

356
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,634
be like we never existed.

357
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,595
We'll catch them.

What... What are we doing, man?

359
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,444
We... We need a plan. We
can't just sneak around.

360
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,945
This is the plan. Shh.

361
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,917

No.

It's remarkable.

00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:45,007
Truly remarkable.

-It's me.

You nearly gave
me a heart attack.

383
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,884
Sorry. We, uh...

384
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,261
we've got no place else to go.

385
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,888
What are you doing
here? Who's this?

386
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,557
Did you... God, did you
hit him with my car?

387
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,517
I don't know how
to tell you this.

388
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,644
Chief Ashworth is dead.

389
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:41,230
-What?
-[Tim] Drew shot him.

390
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,982
What are you talking about?

391
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,818
I am telling you, the Chief
is dead, we are in trouble,

392
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,695
and we need your help right now.

393
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:48,905
Well, who is this?

394
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:53,618
-Reynolds.
-[Drew] Yes.

395
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,203
Find a place to
pull over up ahead.

396
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:58,247
And... And start thinking about
where they might have gone,

397
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:01,042
who Jamieson has that
he still might trust.

398
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,044
-Okay. Got it.
-Yeah.

399
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,712
You're gonna pull
over behind him.

400
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,047
I'm going back to Dennison.

401
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,007
You keep going, keep
the pressure on,

402
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,301
drive 'em into the cordon.

403
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,844
You're going back?

404
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,221
Yeah.

405
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,098
That clerk, uh...

406
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:19,977
Also, kids tend to hide
when they're scared,

407
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,271
not run.

408

[tires squealing]

[Wendy] Looks like there's
more to the article.

410
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:03,104
Yeah, that's... what loaded
before it all went dead.

411
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:06,607
Tim? Says he's a
person of interest.

412
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:08,276
I was kidnapped.

413
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,028
[sighing] I'm so sorry, Luke.

414
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:14,115
It's awful. Beyond.

415
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,618
God, you need medical
attention, psychological care,

416
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,662
social services.

417
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,372
What are you doing? I
mean, this is... this is...

418
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:25,042
-You've got no legal...
-I-I had no choice! All right?

419
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:26,336
If you had seen what
was on that drive...

420
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,004
The drive you left in
the Chief's pocket!

421
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,630
The one that would
prove everything!

422
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,799
-Yeah, I... I know how it sounds.
-Sounds like Annie!

423
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,718
Yeah, and they
fucking killed Annie!

424
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:36,637
Look, if none of this is real,

425
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:38,806
who's jamming your
communications?

426
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,850
Uh, landlines,
Internet, cell service.

427
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,144
Who can do all of that?

428
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,733
Yeah. I just drove Fort Hill,
checking the cell towers.

429
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,651
It looked fine.

430
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,778
Also, all the radios
aren't working.

431
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:55,156
So what? So what? This
is... This is them?

432
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:58,034
All of it? Some
kind of scrambler?

433
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,160
[Luke] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

434
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,038
Because that...
that's what they do.

435
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:07,418
I need to get him
out of town, okay?

436
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:11,130
And Drew shot Ashworth?

437
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,758
-Drew shot Ashworth?
-Yes.

438
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,426
-Why?
-Because it makes sense

439
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,845
to have one in the
local cops, okay?

440
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,430
Maybe more than one.

441
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,932
Look, I don't understand
it all, either.

442
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,016
-Yeah.
-But you know...

443
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,434
you know, uh, that reporter?

444
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,852
-Kate whoever?
-Kate Nilson.

445
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,395
She tried to kill us, too.

446
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,357
[Luke] No, no, no. That's true.

447
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,192
Okay? She worked
for the Institute.

448
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:37,073
Okay, you have absolutely
no reason to believe me,

449
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,784
but we are telling
you the truth.

450
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,289
[Wendy exhaling sharply]

451
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,170
Yeah? [sighing]
What do you want?

452
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:55,091
I understand Dixon damaged
the deprivation tank.

453
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,386
"Damaged"? He blasted it apart.

454
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:03,140
You have any idea what kind
of TK power that requires?

455
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:07,186
A full house on a Sparkler
Night can't do that.

456
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,439
It's orders of magnitude
bigger than what we've seen.

457
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:14,193
You told us TK was too
weak to be weaponized.

458
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,112
It always was! It's not just me.

459
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,906
All of us. All the literature.

460
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,201
No one has ever had
a TK that strong,

461
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,245
not that could be verified.

462
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,414
Of course, there
were always rumors.

463
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:29,750
Presents some
intriguing new options.

464
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,919
There's no options!

465
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:35,172
We're simply not prepared to
deal with that kind of power.

466
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,925
Dixon's a time bomb.

467
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:41,345
We can't leave him like this.

468
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,848
Don't tell me liquidation.

469
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,059
[Sighing]

470
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,895
It would be safest.

471
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:52,773
But no, at the
moment, we need him.

472
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:55,317
So... we Gork him.

473
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,778
Immediately.

474
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:01,532
He conducts tonight, goes
straight to Recovery.

475
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:05,453
He can power The
Hum indefinitely.

476
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:08,831
The answer to our prayers.

477
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,130
Hey.

478
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,348
You better hurry up and eat.
I'm shutting this up soon.

479
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,435
It's Sparkler Night.

480
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:37,234
Here we go, Sha. Here
comes the airplane.

481
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,530
Come on, Sha.

482
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,949
You can't do Sparkler
Night on an empty stomach.

483
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,413
Oh, shit.

484
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,874
Avery, my man.

485
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,007
[Avery, telepathically]
What's wrong with Kalisha?

486
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,843
She's going, man.

487
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:04,970
They're all going.

488
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:08,891
Then me, then you.

489
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,059
Gorked.

490
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:19,026
Nicky, help me. Hold my hand.

491
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,195
[Nicky, telepathically]
What do you want me to do?

492
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,947
Just help me.

493
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:29,453
Kalisha.

494
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:32,373
Can you hear me?

495
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,333
[Nicky] Kalisha.

496
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,043
[Avery] Kalisha.

497
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:39,004
[Kalisha, telepathically]
Go away. I have to hide.

498
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:41,173
[Nicky] Wake up,
Kalisha, please.

499
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:44,552
-[Avery] Sha?
-[Nicky] Please, Kalisha.

500
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:48,389
[Avery] Kalisha.

501
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,225
[gagging, coughing]

502
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,520
[gagging]

503
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,909
Hey, look who it is.

504
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,245
It's Avester.

505
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,956
You're a sight for sore
eyes. I missed you.

506
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,083
I missed you too.

507
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,550
Someone give me a smoke. Today.

508
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,471
[Joanne exhaling sharply]

509
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,475
It's Sparkler Night. Eat up.

510
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:39,398
[Kalisha] Did Luke escape?

511
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,942
I felt it.

512
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:45,487
[Avery] Yeah, he's out.
They're scared shitless.

513
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:48,407
[Kalisha] I thought so.
I thought I felt him go.

514
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,492
-Fuck, yeah.
-Shh.

515
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,957
[Kalisha] Can you talk to him?

516
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,376
[Avery] I can feel
him sometimes.

517
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,254
He's not strong enough
to talk back to me.

518
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:04,465
But me... I'm strong.

519
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:08,093
I'm a lot stronger
than they know.

520
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:11,555
Strong enough to do something.

521
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,974
[Kalisha] We can't
escape, Avery.

522
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:15,559
[Avery] I have the pieces.

523
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:18,187
I don't know how to
put them together.

524
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:24,652
Thank you.

525
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,655
Ah, okay, so, we are
gonna run out of time

526
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:30,115
because they, uh...
they are not dumb.

527
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:31,367
-Just a minute.
-All right.

528
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,327
So, we... we head out,
stick to back roads.

529
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,371
-Yeah.
-Boston. Montreal.

530
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:39,166
-[Knocking]
-[Drew] Wendy? You in there?

531
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,630
-Wendy!
-[Wendy] Yeah, hold on.

532
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:45,756
-Let's go.
-No, no, no!

533
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,466
Go in here. Go in here.

534
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,009
Go on. We'll close it.

535
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:50,427
-[Drew] You all right?
-Hold on!

536
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:55,224
[exhaling sharply] I'm coming.

537
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:58,185
What's with the radios?

538
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,687
I tried changing the battery...
what are you doing, Drew?

539
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,147
What's going on? Sorry.
Who are you, exactly?

540
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,108
How many guesses do you need?

541
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,530
Oh, the FBI doesn't care
about warrants anymore?

542
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,240
[Sigsby] You're law enforcement.

543
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,284
Shouldn't take a warrant
to ensure your cooperation.

544
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:14,493
With what?

545
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,161
What are you doing, Drew?

546
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:19,665
[Sigsby] What's the last
you hear from Tim Jamieson?

547
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,334
Tim? Why? Is there
something wrong?

548
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:25,337
Afraid so. Last contact?

549
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:31,343
Uh, last night, he
borrowed my car.

550
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:32,720
-[door closing]
-Tell you why he needed it?

551
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,263
Why are you asking me about Tim?

552
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,349
[Sigsby] He may have had a...

553
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:39,601
a breakdown... of some kind.

554
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:40,728
A breakdown?

555
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,563
A break with reality.

556
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:46,066
There's substantial mental
illness in his family history.

557
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,068
How the fuck do you know that?

558
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:51,321
Wendy. Tim shot Chief Ashworth.

559
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:53,824
That's not possible.
Okay? No way.

560
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,493
It's true. We were
just at the station.

561
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:59,246
The Chief told you Tim shot him?

562
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,498
Chief didn't tell us
anything. Chief is dead.

563
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,502
What?

564
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:09,339
I'm sorry, Wendy.
I'm really sorry.

565
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:12,217
Oh, my God. Well, what's
Amanda going to do?

566
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,428
She... this... this... this
doesn't make any sense.

567
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:15,637
Well, it's...

568
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,431
He's the prime
suspect at this point.

569
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,433
I'm telling you, Wendy, I saw
him on my way out this morning.

570
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,394
It sounded like he'd been
drinking Annie's Kool-Aid,

571
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:24,313
talking about astronauts,
a hole in the moon.

572
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,647
Well, I still don't believe it.

573
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,775
And even if it's true, it
doesn't change the fact

574
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,193
that he's not in
my fucking house!

575
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,736
So, if you two don't mind...

576
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,280
Drew, get the fuck out!

577
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,157
Drew, what the
fuck are you doing?

578
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:40,829
Hey, Drew.

579
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,834
Ah! Ah! Hands.

580
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,586
Let's not make this worse.

581
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:48,796
It's already worse.

582
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,589
Back up against the
wall, both of you.

583
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,549
Hands where I can see them.

584
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:53,801
You won't...

585
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:54,884
-[Gun firing]
-[Gasping]

586
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,805
Sure, I will.

587
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,431
Ah! Jesus, Tim!

588
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:00,850
I told you, he's gone crazy!
We have to do something!

589
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,393
Shut up! Just shut up!

590
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:05,813
You shot the Chief
right in front of us,

591
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,356
so don't fuck with me.

592
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:13,487
That's her, the one
I told you about.

593
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,655
Mm-hmm.

594
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:18,158
Luke. I'm worried about you.

595
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:20,452
Wendy, if you wouldn't mind

596
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,830
taking these two into the
other room and tying them up,

597
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:24,498
relieving them of their weapons.

598
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,375
[exhaling sharply]

599
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,544
Don't tell me you're buying
this bullshit they're spinning.

600
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:29,545
How long have we
known each other?

601
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,671
-He's snapped!
-[Tim] Move!

602
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,089
All right, all right, all right.

603
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,508
There's no point arguing.
Let's de-escalate, right?

604
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,468
Like they taught us. There!

605
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:39,179
There! Come on. Have
everyone calm down.

606
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:42,683
Let's let Tim calm down.

607
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,351
We'll sort all this out.

608
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:47,396
Let's just... Let's just not
point guns at each other.

609
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,480
Tim.

610
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,691
Tim, look at me.

611
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,860
Let me disarm both of you, okay?

612
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,737
I'll establish chain-of-custody
on Drew's sidearm,

613
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,740
and forensics will show if
it's what killed the Chief.

614
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,617
There's not got gonna be
any forensics, right, Drew?

615
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,369
I'm sure the Chief's
body's already gone.

616
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:06,540
Still, I would be very
happy to put this gun down,

617
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:09,793
just as soon as you disarm
him and Miss FBI over there.

618
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,503
She's not FBI.

619
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:16,717
It's a good time to
de-escalate, like she said.

620
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,305
Drew?

621
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:22,472
Okay.

622
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:25,935
-[Gasping]
-[Tim] Hey! Hey! Hey!

623
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,728
Let her go! Let her go now!

624
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,605
Let her go right now, man!

625
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,697
[Wendy gasping]

626
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,534
[Wendy breathing heavily]

627
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:45,203
Drew. Drew, Drew, Drew.

628
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,961
Just give me a reason.

629
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,340
Mm.

630
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:11,813
I know this must feel like
a very dark time for you.

631
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,361
Give me it.

632
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,537
[breathing unsteadily]

633
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,964
Clearly, he's been
telling you things...

634
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,966
Yeah, no shit. You
kill Annie yourself?

635
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:39,967
-[Wendy] Tim?
-What?

636
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,468
You killed Drew.

637
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,845
He killed the Chief
and he just shot me.

638
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,890
I know. I've known him
since we were kids.

639
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:48,976
Mr. Jamieson,

640
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,978
I haven't killed anyone.
You're making a huge mistake,

641
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,562
and based on what?

642
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:55,607
The words of a scared,
confused child.

643
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:56,691
Maureen made a video.

644
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,448
Oh, well...

645
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:04,866
[sighing] That's unfortunate.

646
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,618
Why?

647
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,453
It means we're all dead.

648
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,373
Yeah?

649
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,754
What was on this video?

650
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:18,839
All of it.

651
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,757
Your...

652
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:23,010
"Gorks." All of it.

653
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:25,888
I think it went all
the way through.

654
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:28,056

00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:42,863
All right, let me take a look.

657
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,076
I told him everything.

658
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,747
No, you didn't.

659
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,707
[Luke] What does that mean?

660
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,460
-You don't know everything.
-I know...

661
00:38:56,543 --> 00:39:00,922
what you do to us, kids like me,

662
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,425
like Kalisha, like Avery,

663
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,427
and I know what you
did to my parents.

664
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,637
Yeah, but you don't know why.

665
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,016
Smartest kid in the world
doesn't think to ask why.

666
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,561
What's to know? You're using us

667
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,813
to commit the perfect crime...

668
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:19,399
murders with no
physical evidence.

669
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:21,735
You're... You're a hit
squad. you're assassins

670
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:24,029
or whatever you wanna call it.

671
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,073
And you're the blind
man who felt the tail

672
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,450
and thought he could
describe the whole elephant.

673
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,702
We should just shoot her.

674
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,497
It's... not as
easy as you think.

675
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,707
She'll kill all
of us, if she can.

676
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:38,168
No. Not all of you.

677
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,420
Not if I don't have to.

678
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,672
Go ahead. Describe the elephant.

679
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,010
What's the point?

680
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,179
You're gonna kill me anyway.

681
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,098
Not if I don't have to.

682
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,482
I'm going for my cigarette.

683
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,067
Mm-hmm.

684
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,617
Yes.

685
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:17,124
Yes, the Institute is involved
in untraceable assassinations.

686
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,875
-I told you.
-Fucking A.

687
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,627
But the real question
is who we target.

688
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,754
Why does that matter?

689
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:24,006
You... you think we
do this for money?

690
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,549
Or politics?

691
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,678
You've seen the news
about Senator Ramsey,

692
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,596
died in a small
plane crash recently?

693
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,558
-Yeah, I heard that was you.
-Yeah.

694
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:38,854
Ramsey's what we call a "hinge."

695
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,481
If he'd lived, nine
years from now,

696
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:43,650
he's Secretary of Defense,

697
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:47,195
has a break with reality,
convinces the President

698
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:50,949
to hit North Korea,
limited nuclear strike.

699
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:55,495
The problem is, the missiles
overfly Russian airspace,

700
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:58,832
and Russian
early-warning systems

701
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,001
are old and shitty,

702
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,003
and from their
screens, it looks like

703
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,671
we're coming for them.

704
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,215
They have moments to
react. They launch.

705
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:09,176
We have moments
to react to that.

706
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,677
-We launch.
-Did you say,

707
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,679
"Nine years from now"?

708
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:13,930
Give or take.

709
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:16,516
-[Tim] Uh-huh.
-[Sigsby] I know.

710
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,893
Hard to fathom.

711
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,061
But I'm sure you've seen by now,

712
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:23,607
Luke has some rare
abilities, low level.

713
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:28,570
But there's another ability,
more rare, more important...

714
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,197
precognition.

715
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,240
Like telling the future?

716
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,825
The PC track.

717
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:38,121
How rare?

718
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:40,624
I'm not cleared to know how
many we have at any given time.

719
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,835
How many you have to do what?

720
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:47,214
Find people who will
trigger Armageddon.

721
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,632
Hinges, Tim.

722
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:51,593
Very good.

723
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,303
And once you've found one,

724
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:57,098
you put together
a target package,

725
00:41:57,182 --> 00:42:00,268
and they turn over to
you for elimination.

726
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:01,937
Right?

727
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,899
Since 1950, we've
saved the world,

728
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:09,110
I don't know, over 500 times.

729
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,992
Yes, people have died, but
billions have been saved.

730
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:18,078
So, you're the math whiz.

731
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:21,831
You understand
cost-benefit ratios.

732
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:23,833
This is... it's bullshit.
It's fucking bullshit.

733

Okay. Well, what would
you do? What would you do?

734
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,798
What would you do
to save the world?

735
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:34,594
Whatever it takes?

736
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:36,304
Correct.

737
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,598
I don't get to have
crises of conscience.

738
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:40,016
I don't get to...

739
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,020
to feel sad for
some particular kid

740
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:46,773
and his poor, particular
grieving Mommy,

741

or the mission fails.

742
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,277
And full nuclear exchange?

743
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,780
Four billion people
die in two hours.

744
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,365
Within ten years,

745
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:59,202
throw in 99 percent
of plants and...

746
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:01,997
animals, if you care
about that kind of thing.

747
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,125
Yeah.

748
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:11,715
You can see my
thoughts. Am I lying?

749
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:17,971
She's not lying.

750
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:21,016
[Tim] That just means
she believes it.

751
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,309
So, tell me this.

752
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,686
If you really are
saving the world,

753
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,688
why not do it out in the open?

754
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,733
Why all the secrecy? Why
not let us all decide?

755
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,151
[Sigsby] We can't run that risk.

756
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,736
You understand that.

757
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,823
You shot a child in Boston
to prevent a massacre.

You walk out of here
