1
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,935
Previously on The Institute...

2
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,996
- The fuck is that?
- Nobody knows.

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,814
Happens every week or so.

4
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,608
The Red Steps Tragedy?

5
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,402
Yeah. Annie was obsessed with it.

6
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:31,281
"Notre Pain." It's some
weird inside joke they all had.

7
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,033
We never understood it.

8
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,410
Stay away from Route 10.

9
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,454
What? The research place?

10
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,540
The infectious-disease whatever it is?

11
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,501
- Harry!
- Shut up!

12
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:46,463
Harry Cross and the Wilcox girls

13
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,465
are resting comfortably

14
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,593
and expected to make a full recovery.

15
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,388
We're all fucking kids here.

16
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,307
I can't do anything.

17
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,727
I'm a glorified janitor.

18
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,646
You're stronger than you think, Maureen.

19
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,648
Some of your test scores

20
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,986
aren't corroborating
with the progress...

21
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,779
you're clearly making.

22
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,823
Maybe because the tests are bullshit,

23
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,825
and so is this place, and so are you,

24
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,535
with all due respect.

25
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,495
I'm not the enemy, Luke.

26
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,831
You've been working with
Luke Ellis off-the-books.

27
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,833
It was Stackhouse's idea.

28
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,876
He's the one who told me to keep going.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,503
What about Ellis?

30
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,338
What about him?

31
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:32,467
We still need to
find a way to prove he's TP.

32
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,053
Leave that to me.

33
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:38,557
Yeah, pretty much all they do
is gather us for Movie Nights.

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,437
Last night, we were brushing
our teeth, then we were driving,

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,730
then we were doing 'doctor stuff',

36
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,648
like checking in on patients,

37
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,859
giving injections, that sort of thing.

38
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,904
Something's wrong inside her head.

39
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,865
Movie nights take a toll.

40
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,992
First, they'll have her lead
a Sparkler night.

41
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:01,705
And then, they'll move her to Recovery.

42
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,374
That's where The Hum's coming from.

43
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,672
Okay. I gotta go.

44
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,050
Luke, I know what's behind that door,

45
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,843
the one that Sha showed us.

46
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,678
I saw it in Maureen's head.

47
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,448
* Shout, shout *

48
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,576
* Let it all out *

49
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,914
* These are the things
I can do without *

50
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,542
* Come on *

51
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,169
* I'm talking to you *

52
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,004
* Come on *

53
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:59,429
* In violent times *

54
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,433
* You shouldn't have to sell your soul *

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,940
* In black and white *

56
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,027
* They really, really ought to know *

57
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,991
* Shout, shout *

58
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,786
* Let it all out *

59
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:27,707
* These are the things
I can do without *

60
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,000
* Come on *

61
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,963
* I'm talking to you *

62
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,422
* Come on *

63
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,745
She's the survivor
from last night's incident?

64
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,956
Hendricks said
that, uh, she gorked out early.

65
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,752
Something about, uh,
the psychic bond with her sister

66
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,046
being violently severed.

67
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,298
That's a new one.

68
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,799
Uh, anyway,

69
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,719
um, Sigsby figures

70
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,721
that there's still
some juice worth squeezing.

71
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,056
Hmm.

72
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,603
Uh, is there anything I can do for you?

73
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,274
Now that you mention it, would
you mind taking out the trash?

74
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,611
We're short-staffed back here.
I'd appreciate the help.

75
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,820
Okay.

76
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,656
We weren't expecting him

77
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,908
to kick out
for at least another day or so.

78
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,744
Denny's already in there,
getting it ready.

79
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,162
He'll help you load.

80
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,299
Get the door.

81
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,658
Okay?

82
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,618
- Yeah.
- All right, on three.

83
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,203
Okay. One, two, three.

84
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,332
Watch your wrist.

85
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,063
We all go up the chimney here.

86
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,403
No.

87
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,240
'Cause I'm not gonna let that happen.

88
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,208
Send the Ellis kid in.

89
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,839
Luke.

90
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:54,099
Have you ever heard the phrase
"Veritas liberabit vos?"

91
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,059
"The truth will set you free."

92
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,395
Hmm.

93
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,108
So, are you, um,
finally setting me free?

94
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,238
An intellect like yours can be...

95
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,324
a blessing or a curse.

96
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:16,329
In your case,
it just makes everything harder.

97
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,415
Dr. Hendricks and I believe you're TP.

98
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,752
I wish. 'Cause the sooner I am,
the sooner I go home.

99
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,129
Right?

100
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,925
This... This isn't the place for lying.

101
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,136
Luke, remember, you're here to serve,

102
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,513
not just your country
but the whole world.

103
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,225
Does that ever sound just
a little grandiose to you?

104
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,894
I mean, what does that even mean?

105
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,439
Serving the entire world?

106
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,816
You'll have to trust me.

107
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,943
Trust is earned.

108
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,362
It certainly is.

109
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,187
The truth at last.

110
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,319
What did you do? You killed them!

111
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,071
- Hey, let her go now!
- Why did you do that?

112
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,199
What did you do?

113
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,582
Oh, you'll wish you hadn't done that.

114
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,167
Get off me!

115
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,086
Get off!

116
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,172
- Julia.
- One sec.

117
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,173
Get off!

118
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,883
This is a teachable moment.

119
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:56,513
Julia, we have a problem.

120
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,014
Get off me!

121
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,475
Sigsby! Sigsby!

122
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,065
Can I help you, sir?

123
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,067
Sure hope so.

124
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,401
I'm Dennison's new night knocker.

125
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,362
- How are you?
- Hm. Night knocker, huh?

126
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,030
Well, that's a new one on me.

127
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,407
It's really just a night watchman.

128
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,494
You know, "Two o'clock and all is well."

129
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,497
Hmm. So you came all the way
out here from Dennison

130
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,415
to make sure all is well?

131
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,210
Oh, no. I'm sure
you guys got that covered.

132
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,546
Not back on shift till sundown tomorrow.

133
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,215
Like I said, I'm new to town.

134
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,217
Thought it was gonna
be nice weather for a hike,

135
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,470
but I think I must've got
kind of turned around here.

136
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,557
So there's a man at the gate. So what?

137
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,559
He's the new Dennison night knocker,

138
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,102
the one I told you about.

139
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,270
The one who was talking
to the crazy woman.

140
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,188
Yeah.

141
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,942
Is this the Institute up there?

142
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,236
People in town, they talk about
it like it's the Wonka factory.

143
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,613
What exactly goes on in there, man?

144
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,407
Infectious disease research.

145
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,908
Really?

146
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,247
You don't always see barbed wire
on the inside of a fence.

147
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,748
Well, you know, we have test animals.

148
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,251
People are real uptight nowadays
about security protocols,

149
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,962
lab leaks, all that shit.

150
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,089
We should've taken him out, too.

151
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,342
You agreed it wasn't a problem
unless she mentioned us.

152
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,554
Well, clearly, it's a problem.

153
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,932
It's a lot of security for a lab.

154
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,142
Well, state of the world nowadays.

155
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,269
Fences and walls,

156
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,396
good guys keeping the bad guys out.

157
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,025
I imagine the...

158
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,570
hard part is keeping straight who's who.

159
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,572
He disappears.

160
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,534
The cops'll figure you hire a drifter,

161
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,953
sooner or later, he keeps drifting.

162
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,079
Bodies bring attention.

163
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,291
You're awful quick to pull the trigger.

164
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,001
- Better safe than sorry.
- Exactly.

165
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,629
- Meaning?
- He's a physically conditioned,

166
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,714
military-aged male.

167
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,090
He fits the profile.

168
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,592
He could be anything.

169
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,136
Investigative journalist.

170
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,555
Undercover FBI.

171
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,643
Killing him could create
more problems than it solves.

172
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:11,439
He could be from Upstairs,
sent to test us.

173
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,398
Shit.

174
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,735
You got a ride back to town, sir?

175
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,487
You know what?

176
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,197
I think I might've parked,
actually, just down that road.

177
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,491
Yeah, well, you have a good day, sir.

178
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,409
Yeah.

179
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,952
You, too.

180
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,501
We need to find out who he really is.

181
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,046
Yeah. Then we kill him.

182
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,292
So, the Avester told us
about your parents.

183
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,462
I'm so sorry, Luke.

184
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,297
Me, too. It's fucked.

185
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,091
I want you to take a hit of this, okay?

186
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,093
- No.
- Oh, come on.

187
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,188
Can't let these fuckers win, Luke.

188
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:37,066
They already have. It's over.

189
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,193
No way. We can still get out of here.

190
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,404
Get out and go where?

191
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,240
I don't have anywhere to go anymore.

192
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,075
Welcome to the fucking club, dude.

193
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,368
I've never had anywhere to go,

194
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,828
but anywhere is better than here.

195
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,248
What's the point in fighting
if you know you can't win?

196
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,583
Sometimes you win just by showing them

197
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,209
you're still willing to fight.

198
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,463
Yeah? Look where that got you. Hmm?

199
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,631
There's a chance. You never know
what might happen.

200
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,176
We need you. Kalisha needs you.

201
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,179
I can't help you. We're all just kids.

202
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,765
What the fuck are we supposed to do?

203
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,142
We can find a way to get revenge
on that fucking bitch Sigsby,

204
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,769
on this whole fucking place, man.

205
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,854
Please, Luke. Please.

206
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,564
Look, I've been thinking
about what you said

207
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,274
about those motion cameras
in the hallway,

208
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,317
how they can detect your body heat...

209
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,777
I don't care, Nicky.

210
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,779
I figure if we can get
into the AC closet,

211
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,739
maybe we can find a way
to raise the temperature enough

212
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,282
to produce that, you know,

213
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,784
"motion white-out"
you were talking about.

214
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,827
It's all bullshit, man.

215
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,454
Even that closet

216
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,373
has got the electrical
sensory lock on it, so...

217
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,628
Cameras pointed at it,
so it's... not gonna happen.

218
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,550
Attention, Front Half!

219
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:49,680
Please join us in the cafeteria
for Nicky's graduation party.

220
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,766
Yay.

221
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:56,270
Chef Doug has made
a special carrot cake.

222
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,272
We hear that's Nicky's favorite.

223
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,196
Well, that's our cue.

224
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,447
Coming?

225
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,579
You should come.

226
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,708
I'm planning something. You'll dig it.

227
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,217
* Goodbye Front Half for you *

228
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,512
* Goodbye Front Half for you *

229
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,932
* Goodbye Front Half, dear Nicky *

230
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,229
* Goodbye Front Half for you *

231
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,939
Whoo!

232
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,706
Cake's really good.
You should have some.

233
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,541
I don't want to eat anything.

234
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,631
I just keep thinking
I'm gonna... wake up.

235
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,635
Luke.

236
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,803
Don't die here.

237
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,348
Don't let me die here. We're too young.

238
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,731
Young and beautiful, right?

239
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,358
Didn't want to be the one to say it.

240
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,361
All right.

241
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,239
Mr. Wilholm, congratulations!

242
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,867
Time to go.

243
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,001
Why don't you tell them
the truth about this place?

244
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,253
Why don't you tell them

245
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,590
that none of us are ever
getting out of here alive?

246
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,595
More of Nicky's conspiracies.

247
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,847
We know about the chimneys.

248
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,480
We know what happens in Back Half.

249
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,774
Move.

250
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,027
Where do you think you're going?
Stop what you're doing!

251
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,869
Do your fucking job!

252
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,455
You little prick!

253
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,712
Stop it! Leave him alone!

254
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,631
Nicky!

255
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,549
No!

256
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,684
Fuck you! Fuck all of you!
You fucking pussies!

257
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,396
Stop.

258
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,605
Stop!

259
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:53,656
Wow. How many men does it take
to restrain one teenage boy?

260
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,461
But he wasn't even that mad.

261
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,630
Nicky wasn't that mad?

262
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,549
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

263
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,055
Yeah. He was doing it for you...

264
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,601
and for George and Sha.

265
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,976
You okay?

266
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,729
They're sending me to Back Half soon.

267
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,981
I thought your TP tests
were still inconclusive.

268
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,900
No. Not anymore.

269
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,736
So if you're still willing
to help me get out of here,

270
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,404
the time is now.

271
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:23,079
Did you know...
that they murdered my parents?

272
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,830
What makes you think that?

273
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,541
I don't think it. I know it.

274
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,794
And I know you, Maureen.

275
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,796
You're better than this.

276
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,674
You hate it as much as we do.

277
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:39,053
I can't. They'll kill me.

278
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,931
What if it was your son in here?

279
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,517
Stop it, Luke, please.

280
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,477
If Jake were here, would you
just stand back and let him die?

281
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,048
Hi.

282
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,050
Did you find that stuff
that I asked for?

283
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,137
Well, how's my car? Did you gas it up?

284
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,596
What?

285
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,890
Uh, no. Sorry.

286
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,976
I, uh...

287
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,978
Again, I appreciate you
letting me borrow it.

288
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,147
I'm glad to know that you trust me.

289
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,524
Let's say I'm still on the fence.

290
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,569
Although I certainly do seem to
be risking a lot on your hunch.

291
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,071
You know what the Chief'll do
if he finds out I took these?

292
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,700
Nothing's supposed
to leave the Records room.

293
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,245
I know, and, uh, thank you,

294
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,205
really.

295
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,173
It's... it's not just a hunch.

296
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,758
There is something very wrong
with Annie's death,

297
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,510
and I am gonna find out what.

298
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,888
Hate to quote the Chief,
but that's not your job anymore.

299
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,556
Somebody's getting away with something,

300
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,768
and maybe it is just Annie,
but maybe it's something more.

301
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,228
And I just...

302
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:14,690
Look, job or not, I guess...

303
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,485
I'm just not the kinda guy
who can look the other way.

304
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,698
Guess you at least
get points for self-awareness.

305
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,285
Mostly building permits.

306
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,705
Honestly, woulda thought
there'd be more.

307
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,750
This is the part where you tell
me why we need all this stuff.

308
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,543
What did you find up there?

309
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:35,961
Notre Pain.

310
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,672
Like from the yearbook?

311
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,090
Mm-hmm.

312
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,176
Nobody could ever figure out

313
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,886
what Zoe Sloane
and the other kids were doing

314
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,888
at the Red Steps, right?

315
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,224
I mean, they knew that it was dangerous.

316
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,559
They knew there were many people
who drowned up there.

317
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,936
Well, they were drunk.

318
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,229
We figured it must have been
a dare or something.

319
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,648
Well, what if they were
never there that night?

320
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,983
What if they didn't die there?
What if that's just what...

321
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,237
What if that's just
where they found their bodies?

322
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,864
Who'd wanna...

323
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:07,117
Anybody ever really,
really look into the Institute?

324
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,703
I mean, like the Chief
or Inspections or anything?

325
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,956
Pretty sure it's federal.
We don't have jurisdiction.

326
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,297
Okay, well, right, um, here,

327
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,633
that is where the old fence collapsed.

328
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,635
When I went up there,
I was looking around

329
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,720
and there was
a big "no trespassing" sign

330
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,764
with a bunch of letters missing.

331
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,848
Guess what it says now.

332
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,267
"Notre Pain"?

333
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,602
- Mm-hmm.
- You think

334
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,729
that's where Zoe Sloane
and her friends went that night.

335
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,064
I don't know.

336
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,315
But it's...

337
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,194
I don't know.

338
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,988
I don't know.

339
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,992
I wasn't sure whether to show you this.

340
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,871
Two weeks after the Red Steps kids died,

341
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,624
the Institute broke ground
on a new perimeter fence.

342
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,793
It wasn't just a new fence.
It was a whole new fire road.

343
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,378
Before the new fence went up,

344
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,214
they would have a clear shot all
the way down to the Institute.

345
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:06,802
Being a teenager around here
is lethally boring.

346
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,142
Even if this is right,

347
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,352
there won't be
any evidence anymore, so...

348
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,773
We're not looking for evidence.

349
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,652
No? That's not something

350
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,362
that big-city cops have to worry about?

351
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,408
Sometimes we do.

352
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,328
Sometimes we just kind
of... poke the bear

353
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,829
until something comes back at us.

354
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,957
What'd you do?

355
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,669
Hopefully,

356
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,755
I put myself on their radar.

357
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:01,690
I'm... I'm sorry about earlier, Maureen.

358
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:02,983
I shouldn't have asked you to do it.

359
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,110
How would you do it, get out of here?

360
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,862
Do you have a plan?

361
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:14,036
The chain link, uh,
in the yard in Back Half,

362
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,081
there's a piece of it that's
come away from the foundation.

363
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,666
I just don't have a way
to get there, so...

364
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:25,881
Can you get to the laundry room
without anyone seeing you?

365
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,176
I would need a key card
for the elevator.

366
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,762
Say I got you one.
What about the cameras?

367
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,724
We think we have a way around it.

368
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,893
Okay.

369
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,353
I can't take you
all the way to the fence,

370
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,397
but I can get you close.

371
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,066
Be in the laundry room by 11:30,
not a minute later.

372
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,360
Okay. Yeah.

373
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,907
Make sure I get it back.

374
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,159
They freak out over a missing card.

375
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,953
Total lockdown.

376
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,084
And, um, the...

377
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,293
Oh.

378
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:13,929
Sorry. It's all I could find.

379
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,080
Get Maureen in here.

380
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,171
Come here. Here you go.

381
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,799
A little melon for ya.
Come on. It's your favorite.

382
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,509
Oh, yeah. There you go. There you go.

383
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,554
Oh, Tim Jamieson, speak of the Devil.

384
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,139
Mr. Hollister,
it's my night off, so I just...

385
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,016
Fella here to see you.

386
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,853
Trevor Stackhouse.

387
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,482
Tim Jamieson.

388
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,151
What can I do for you, Mr. Stackhouse?

389
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,320
I run security for the place

390
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,239
you were sniffing around this afternoon.

391
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,408
Ah. The Institute.

392
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:21,038
That's the one.
Is there somewhere we can talk?

393
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,833
[ma Right, but where on the flowchart...

394
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,543
...first door is after.

395
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,212
You guys are useless.

396
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,047
Look at this. If you just look at it,

397
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,382
visually you'll see.

398
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,344
Figure out bird, then flowers...

399
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,180
Hey, what the fuck? I'm watching that.

400
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,141
- I wanna watch cartoons!
- Wait your turn!

401
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,936
I wanna watch cartoons!

402
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,063
Hey!

403
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:49,149
Ahh! I wanna watch cartoons!

404
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,486
Hey! Break it up! Now!

405
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,613
Enough! Enough!

406
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,907
- I wanna watch cartoons!
- Break it up!

407
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,075
Break it up!

408
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,327
No! Cartoons!

409
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,580
Cartoons!

410
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,541
- I wanna watch cartoons!
- Break it up!

411
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,384
- Cartoons!
- You took my turn!

412
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,511
- Enough!
- I get to watch cartoons!

413
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,058
That's enough!

414
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,029
How long were you with Boston PD?

415
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,324
Fifteen years.

416
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,451
Good long stretch.

417
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:46,206
You didn't wanna finish out your 20,

418
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,333
qualify for a full pension?

419
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,044
It was time for a change.

420
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,921
Yeah.

421
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:57,467
Makes me wonder, how's a fella
like you become a night knocker

422
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,469
in a town like this?

423
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,430
I read about
the Westfield Mall incident.

424
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,433
Must weigh heavy on a man,

425
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,268
shoot a boy that young.

426
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:12,649
Appears you have me at a disadvantage.

427
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:16,945
An instructor of mine used to say,

428
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,699
"Always pays to know the other
guy more than he knows you."

429
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,451
Instructor in what?

430
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,704
How did you come to be outside
our place this afternoon?

431
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,040
Your place?

432
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,333
Well, like I said to your guy, I was...

433
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,668
Hiking. Yeah.

434
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,963
Exploring your new environs.

435
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,632
That's right.

436
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,552
Plus, I've been getting up
to speed on my local history.

437
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,055
You wouldn't happen
to have been working there

438
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,307
back in '08 when those kids drowned?

439
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,142
I was.

440
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,480
- Terrible thing.
- Mm-hmm.

441
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,316
Friend of mine
has a theory about those kids,

442
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,485
that they never
went swimming that night,

443
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,655
that they actually got caught
breaking into your place.

444
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:04,201
Bunch of bored small-town kids
looking for adventure, you know.

445
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,745
And what did your friend say
happened next?

446
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:10,207
I'm on the edge of my seat.

447
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:15,087
You interview everyone who shows
up at the gate, Mr. Stackhouse?

448
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,548
Especially the ones
with military backgrounds.

449
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:25,180
We're a popular target
for conspiracy theorists.

450
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,349
Used to be, we'd ignore them,

451
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,310
but in the age of social media,
that only allows them to fester.

452
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:35,691
We've decided it best
to confront them directly.

453
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:40,320
Speaking of, I'd be happy
to talk to your friend,

454
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,073
see if I can't put her at ease.

455
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,705
Well, you can't.

456
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,123
She's dead.

457
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,541
Oh.

458
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,377
Pity.

459
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,297
Well, Mr. Jamieson, if you have
any questions in the future

460
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:02,551
about our operation,

461
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,471
please don't hesitate to reach out.

462
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,639
Thanks.

463
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,646
I won't.

464
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,569
What do you have for me?

465
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,195
Well, um, obviously,

466
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,365
Harry and the twins
threw everyone for a loop,

467
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,410
and then the unpleasantness
with Nicky's departure...

468
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,162
Maureen, Maureen!

469
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,623
Luke Ellis. what do you have for me?

470
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,667
After Nicky's graduation,
he said something

471
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:39,129
that upset you, you walked away...

472
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,800
He believes we killed his parents.

473
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:48,305
I thought we don't do that.

474
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:53,226
We try not to. We really do.

475
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,604
But his mother woke during the snatch,

476
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,106
so...

477
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,775
collateral damage.

478
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,447
Have you developed an attachment to him?

479
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,368
Of course not.

480
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,703
Have you ever?

481
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,206
No.

482
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,834
I'm proud to say I haven't.

483
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,712
You know the protocol
for undue attachment:

484
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:25,509
stay away from Front Half
until Luke graduates, and,

485
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:29,387
in the meantime, go home.

486
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:33,642
But it's a Sparkler Night,
and I'm supposed to assist.

487
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,893
Then, I need to change the Back Half...

488
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,436
Fine. Finish your shift.

489
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,480
But stay awake from Luke Ellis.

490
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,190
Copy that.

491
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,523
What are you...

492
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,192
Twenty-two grams of protein.

493
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,236
You'll need it.

494
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,707
All right, gentlemen, ladies,
you know the drill.

495
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,250
Please take your positions.

496
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,888
So this is movie night, huh?

497
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,307
Doesn't look like much.

498
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,268
Come on, man.

499
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,395
As a matter of fact, Mr. Wilholm,

500
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,897
you have the good luck to be joining us

501
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,316
on a Sparkler night.

502
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,901
Okay. What's the difference?

503
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,278
Movie night's training. This is real.

504
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,323
This is why you're here.
This is your mission.

505
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,826
Everything you do is in service of this.

506
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,661
Great.

507
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,747
I'd hate to think it
was all for nothing.

508
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,249
You know, I've never seen you
leave your office before

509
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,959
except for graduations.

510
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,880
Figured maybe you didn't want
to see how the sausage is made.

511
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,548
Hmm.

512
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,926
Guess this really is a big night, huh?

513
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,511
Seeing as how you haven't had
any time to acclimate,

514
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:37,432
we won't expect you to pull
much weight tonight.

515
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:42,771
Just sit back and ride the wave,
as they say.

516
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,440
I'm sure Ms. Benson will
be happy to talk you through it.

517
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,983
Don't sweat it.

518
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,818
You'll just And I ju feel like you're...

519
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,904
getting pulled along
with the rest of us.

520
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,447
Pulled along where?

521
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,824
Ms. Stanhope will be
our conductor tonight.

522
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,953
Conductor. Like on a train?

523
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,288
Yes. Or an orchestra.

524
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,667
Or perhaps an electrical wire.

525
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,921
It means I'm the lucky girl
who gets to stay awake.

526
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,507
I'm sorry. Awake?

527
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,843
Not like sleep.
Although you do black out and...

528
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:17,347
you do feel better after.
The headache dials it down some.

529
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,308
- For a while.
- Bottom line:

530
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,810
say your goodbyes.

531
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,814
After tonight, Iris is going home.

532
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,982
After Recovery.

533
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:32,028
Of course. Congratulations.

534
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,405
I'm ready.

535
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,950
Whatever happens, no more headaches.

536
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,036
So you've got that going for you,

537
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,414
which is nice.

538
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:44,958
Which is nice.

539
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:03,601
Ladies, gentlemen,
it's time to get started.

540
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,485
Here we go.

541
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,112
All right, everyone, you know the drill.

542
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,698
Time to give yourselves over.

543
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:44,869
Mr. Wilholm, that means
you lean into The Hum,

544
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,122
nothing else. Let it carry you.

545
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,875
The conductor is the only one
who stays present.

546
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,795
Never been much for giving myself over.

547
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,798
Well, in this case,
I advise you to rethink,

548
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,466
for your own safety.

549
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,843
Just close your eyes.

550
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,011
Ms. Stanhope,

551
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,888
you still with us?

552
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,225
You have control?

553
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,769
I think so. I can feel him breathing.

554
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:55,857
The bottle you're looking for
is marked fentanyl citrate.

555
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,901
All the bottles are marked in Russian.

556
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,279
The doctor can read them.
That means you can read them.

557
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,823
All right.

558
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,708
Yes.

559
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:19,756
Tony, can you confirm
they're in the flow?

560
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,929
Confirmed.

561
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,735
Where are you?

562
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,988
Are you... driving?

563
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,197
I know I said just a couple of hours...

564
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,657
Oh, that's just great.

565
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,284
So, you're stealing my fucking car?

566
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,994
- I'm not. Please...
- Mom always says I'm drawn

567
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,871
to unreliable men. She blames my dad.

568
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,206
Wendy, will you listen to me, please?

569
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,668
Look, I get why

570
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,671
you would still be
unsure about all of it...

571
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,340
Annie, the Red Steps thing, me.

572
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,801
But I know that they killed Annie.

573
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:31,637
Oh, God. What's happened?

574
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,932
This guy came to see me,

575
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,684
said he was their head of security.

576
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,019
Well, what'd he want?

577
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,812
Warn me off.

578
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,066
Well, maybe that's not a bad idea.

579
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,819
Yeah, well, I'm sorry about the car.

580
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:49,197
I will have it back
to you by the morning.

581
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,990
Where have I heard that before?

582
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,367
Where are you going?

583
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,078
The Red Steps, I guess.

584
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,913
- Back to Notre Pain.
- You know what the Chief'll do?

585
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,206
He's already pissed.

586
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:02,126
I get it, Wendy. Try not to worry, okay?

587
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,378
I'll be fine.

588
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:07,006
Just, uh, be careful.

589
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,925
I will.

590
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,734
Iris.

591
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,237
Iris?

592
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:43,042
Jesus, you're acting like
you've never seen this before.

593
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,425
All the bullshit in this place.

594
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,262
We still... manage
to keep the trains running.

595
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,348
Not somehow.

596
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,183
You.

597
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,227
Please.

598
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,146
No, really.

599
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,816
I hope Upstairs realize how
lucky they are to have you.

600
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,948
I know you're still mad at me,

601
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:17,368
and you have every right to be.

602
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,787
I just...

603
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,123
I wish we could celebrate,

604
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,834
like always.

605
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,137
All conscripts stable.

606
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,513
'Kay.

607
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,974
Get these kids cleaned up.
Get 'em in bed.

608
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,186
- Good work, everybody.
- Yeah.

609
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,313
Front Half store closet.

610
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,981
Ten minutes.

611
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,362
Did your...

612
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,409
Do your parents ever read the Bible?

613
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:02,205
Oh, yeah. A lot.
But they were always feeling

614
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,832
a lot of other things,

615
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,960
things they weren't a-sposed to.

616
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:09,837
You know who Samson was?

617
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,339
Yeah, with the hair?

618
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,424
The Philistines bribed
his girlfriend to cut it

619
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,301
to take away his strength.

620
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,178
That's right.

621
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:21,349
And after the Philistines
took him prisoner,

622
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,519
Samson prayed...

623
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,354
for the first time in his life.

624
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:32,610
He prayed that he would be able
to regain enough of his strength

625
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,112
to get his revenge.

626
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,116
And when they brought
him to their temple

627
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,955
to show they'd conquered him,

628
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,374
he brought the whole place
down on top of them.

629
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,627
Was he still inside the temple
when he pulled it down?

630
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,339
Yeah. But...

631
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,840
he still won.

632
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,054
"Sometimes you win

633
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,265
just by showing you're
still willing to fight."

634
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,644
We're gonna do more than that.

635
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:10,106
We're gonna bring this whole place down.

636
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,026
Almost time.

637
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,075
Hope it's hot enough.

638
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:38,319
Okay. Maureen's headed back.

639
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,280
Sigsby and Stackhouse
are on their way to storage.

640
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:44,033
The enemy will provide the means
of his own defeat, right?

641
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,743
I don't know what that means.

642
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,037
It means...

643
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,123
we have to turn their strengths
into weaknesses.

644
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,169
Okay.

645
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,172
Okay.

646
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,425
It's time. Let's do it.

647
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,686
There you go.

648
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,030
Come on.

649
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,782
Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

650
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,534
Hey.

651
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,452
I'm gonna stretch the lobe.

652
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:31,372
You open the scissors
and get them into position.

653
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,376
Oh gosh.

654
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,669
Come on, Avery.

655
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,755
I... It's just...

656
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,382
- I can't do it.
- Avery, you have to.

657
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,050
Please. I'm sorry. There's no way.

658
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,510
Okay, we don't have time for this.

659
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,012
No.

660
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,392
Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

661
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,560
Oh, gosh.

662
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,571
Here.

663
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,198
Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

664
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:35,186
I wish you could take me
with you. I wish it bad.

665
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,646
I know. Me, too.

666
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,733
Don't forget about us.

667
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,152
Never.

668
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,697
Okay. Oh, God.

669
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,787
Up and at 'em, Ms. Sigsby.

670
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,629
Don't miss the fun.

671
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:11,680
Well, after the other day,
I was afraid we'd...

672
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,392
Anyway, uh...

673
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,479
I'm glad we could put
the unpleasantness behind us.

674
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,148
Slow down. We're only here

675
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,692
so that if Stackhouse checks his feed,

676
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:26,487
he'll know we're sticking to routine.

677
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,406
Oh.

678
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,574
Um, you okay?

679
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,910
- You need some ice?
- I'm fine.

680
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:36,163
Luke Ellis, your pet project, did this.

681
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:38,332
I'm sending his ass
to the Back Half tomorrow.

682
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:41,627
No, Julia. I need more time with him.

683
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,179
The coast is clear.

684
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,514
Good luck, Luke.

685
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,183
Thanks, Avester. You, too.

686
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,364
Hold on. There's someone coming.

687
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,740
Stay back. Hide behind the corner.

688
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,628
Thanks. That was close.

689
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,589
Give it two more seconds.

690
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,888
'Kay. He's in the cafeteria.

691
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,782
Everything looks good in the lunchroom.

692
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,413
Where are you? I can't see you.

693
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:02,416
Yeah, I'm right
in the middle of the room.

694
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,001
Can you wave your hand
in front of the lens?

695
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,378
Nothing's happening.

696
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:09,924
These fucking cameras need an overhaul.

697
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,759
They're not detecting motion.

698
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,010
Must be the heat.

699
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,678
Fucking sauna.

700
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,513
Hang tight.

701
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,599
I'll let you know when it's safe to go.

702
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,644
Okay, you can go.

703
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,785
Do you realize how important
this could be for the program?

704
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:42,581
The program's down
three recruits since last night.

705
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,041
The Back Half needs bodies.

706
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,710
Your ambitions will have to go on hold.

707
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,003
Julia.

708
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,317
That should be enough time.

709
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,403
If he's been paying attention,

710
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,405
he should know that
you don't last that long.

711
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,407
Oh, no!

712
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,492
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

713
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,330
Julia, wait.

714
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,332
What I said before about Upstairs,

715
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,500
I wasn't just blowing smoke.

716
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:30,004
They really are lucky to have you.

717
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,047
I just...

718
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,341
You were a minute and a half late.

719
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,719
Well, I-I would...

720
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,846
No, but...

721
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,431
All right.

722
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,974
You're clear to the laundry room.

723
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,809
You're clear to the laundry room.

724
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,129
Ms. Sigsby.

725
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,964
Maureen.

726
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:16,467
- All's well?
- Yes, ma'am.

727
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,718
Glad to hear it.

728
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,980
- Luke?
- Maureen.

729
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,693
Cart. In you go.
We don't have much time.

730
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,614
They know my schedule.

731
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,679
Never stops, huh?

732
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:05,015
Uh, gorks do make a mess.

733
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,184
Yeah, tell me about it. Hey, listen,

734
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,436
gonna take one of these towels.
Need a shower before I head out.

735
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,188
Check the laundry room.

736
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,898
Come on. I'm in a rush.

737
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,441
Me and Zeke got a liberty.

738
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:15,943
Gonna head out to
that truck stop on 116,

739
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,696
buy ourself a couple lot lizards.

740
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,657
They're already running low back there.

741
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,618
When Sigsby asks why they're
even lower than they're

742
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,621
supposed to be,
I'll make sure to tell her why.

743
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,831
It's one fucking towel.

744
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,543
Go fuck yourself, Maureen.

745
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,191
Okay, Luke, end of the line.

746
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,155
Here.

747
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,948
Okay.

748
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,576
I've just unlocked the door.

749
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,704
The next one's not locked either.

750
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,038
That'll get you out into the backyard.

751
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:12,541
Once you're past the fence,

752
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,835
just head downhill right to the river.

753
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,004
You're gonna have to cross that river

754
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,506
and then walk downstream
until you get to the Red Steps.

755
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,008
It's a picnic spot.

756
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,676
I'll come and pick you up
once I'm off shift.

757
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,261
Then where do we go?

758
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,681
I-I know a reporter.

759
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,976
They're gonna tell your story.

760
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,192
What is this?

761
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,735
Show the world what goes on here.

762
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,030
We're gonna show the world together.

763
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,656
Don't worry about me.

764
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,245
I just wish I never saw this place.

765
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,042
Thank you, Maureen, really.

766
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,711
Okay. Good luck, Luke.

767
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,885
Okay.

768
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,095
Okay, you... you better go.

769
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,114
Iris?

770
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:32,996
Iris?

771
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,041
Jesus Christ.

772
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:39,670
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Iris, it's okay.

773
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,172
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We're gonna get you out of here.

774
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,258
Okay?

775
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,300
Iris, please.

776
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,813
I'm sorry.
