1
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:19,002
Previously on The Institute...

2
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:20,561
Look, I've been thinking
about what you said

3
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,772
about those motion cameras
in in the hallways,

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,024
- how they can detect your body heat.
- I don't care, Nicky.

5
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,859
I figure if we can get
into the AC closet,

6
00:00:25,884 --> 00:00:28,173
maybe we can find a way to raise
the temperature enough

7
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:31,113
to produce that "motion white-out"
you were talking about.

8
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,911
I can't take you
all the way to the fence,

9
00:00:32,994 --> 00:00:34,685
but I can get you close.

10
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:38,147
Be in the laundry room by 11:30,
not a minute later.

11
00:00:38,397 --> 00:00:40,790
I'm Kate, Kate the Great.

12
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,543
Oh. What do you do, Kate?

13
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:47,296
I run the local paper,
Dennison Weekly Standard.

14
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,714
A journalist.

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,927
Anybody ever really,
really look into the Institute?

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,897
I mean, like the Chief
or Inspections or anything?

17
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,224
Pretty sure it's federal.
We don't have jurisdiction.

18
00:00:58,255 --> 00:00:59,893
What exactly goes on in there, man?

19
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,728
Infectious disease research.

20
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:02,688
Really?

21
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,123
He's the new Dennison night knocker,

22
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,357
the one I told you about.

23
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,377
The one who was talking
to the crazy woman.

24
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,652
Yeah.

25
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,488
You should've taken him out, too.

26
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,825
You agreed it wasn't a problem
unless she mentioned us.

27
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:17,394
Well, clearly, it's a problem.

28
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,273
We're a popular target
for conspiracy theorists.

29
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:25,652
We've decided it best
to confront them directly.

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,845
Once you're past the fence,

31
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,097
just head downhill right to the river.

32
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,764
You're gonna have to cross that river

33
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,543
and then walk downstream
until you get to the Red Steps.

34
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:43,879
I'll come and pick you up
once I'm off shift.

35
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:47,508
I know a reporter.
They're gonna tell your story.

36
00:01:50,802 --> 00:01:52,111
What is this?

37
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,515
Show the world what goes on here.

38
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,082
* Shout, shout *

39
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,459
* Let it all out *

40
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:27,464
* These are the things
I can do without *

41
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:29,216
* Come on *

42
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,011
* I'm talking to you *

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,638
* Come on *

44
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:42,187
* In violent times *

45
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:47,276
* You shouldn't have to sell your soul *

46
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:52,656
* In black and white *

47
00:02:53,615 --> 00:02:57,619
* They really, really ought to know *

48
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:03,375
* Shout, shout *

49
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,669
* Let it all out *

50
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:10,799
* These are the things
I can do without *

51
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:12,467
* Come on *

52
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,221
* I'm talking to you *

53
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,806
* Come on *

54
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,733
You're gonna have to cross that river

55
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,444
and then walk downstream
until you get to the Red Steps.

56
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,549
I'll come and get you
once I'm off shift.

57
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:01,378
Oh, uh, is there a problem?

58
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,548
Ms. Sigsby is not in her office.

59
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,051
We can't find her on any of the cameras,

60
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,511
but the log says she hasn't left.

61
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:12,140
Any idea where she might be?

62
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,726
Actually, I do.

63
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,337
HVAC room.

64
00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:34,496
I know Maintenance is short on manpower.

65
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,232
Don't tell me they've
pressed you into service.

66
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:40,542
When the air-conditioning
was on the fritz yesterday,

67
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,336
I figured it was just another sign

68
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,840
of this place being run down...
sloppiness, carelessness.

69
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,743
But then Maintenance
got around to fixing it.

70
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:52,497
Turns out it wasn't
sloppiness, after all.

71
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,542
Sabotage.

72
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,520
If one of our staff
wanted to fuck this place,

73
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,214
there's a thousand ways more effective.

74
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:03,216
Who said anything about staff?

75
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,719
A child?

76
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:07,821
Which one?

77
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,598
Oh, which one do you think?

78
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:13,310
Ellis. Are you certain?

79
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:15,620
Well, he's due for the Box.

80
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,122
I'll just tell Tony to keep him
in a couple of extra minutes.

81
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,108
I braced the night knocker.

82
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:22,835
And? Is he from Upstairs?

83
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,613
Almost certainly not.

84
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,859
My read: he really is just a drifter,

85
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,528
happened to drift here.

86
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,221
Mm. So...

87
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:35,223
not worth killing?

88
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:37,079
I'm not saying that.

89
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,685
What are you saying?

90
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:43,564
I've met guys like him
in the Forces, other places.

91
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,503
Once they get a hold of something,

92
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:48,740
you have to pry their jaws open
to make them let go.

93
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,597
He won't stop.

94
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,683
So we stop him.

95
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:44,933
Hey.

96
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,227
You've really been out there all night?

97
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:52,105
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess I have.

98
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,875
You find anything at least?

99
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,818
Not sure.

100
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,998
I think I found the spot where...

101
00:13:58,023 --> 00:13:59,921
Zoe Sloane and her friends
used to hang out.

102
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,842
Some kind of... cabin or something.

103
00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:04,260
It's been torn down.

104
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,738
Not much of it left.
It's probably Stackhouse.

105
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,656
He's probably lying about them

106
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,225
- the same way he lied about Annie.
- That might be a leap.

107
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:14,979
Why don't you come back,
tell me about it?

108
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,007
Yeah. Yeah, I will. I just...

109
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,986
I can't help but feel that
I'm missing something, you know?

110
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,130
Something...
something here is very wrong,

111
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,282
and nobody seems to give a shit,
and I am the only one...

112
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,767
<i>I give a shit.</i>

113
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,453
Look, something's wrong. I get it.

114
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:33,356
Come back. I'll help you
figure out what it is.

115
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,193
Also, I need my fucking car.

116
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,072
<i>Tim?</i>

117
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:44,175
Are you there? I've gotta get
to work in like an hour.

118
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,202
Sorry. I'm coming back now.

119
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:48,554
Thanks.

120
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,747
Okay.

121
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,405
Maureen.

122
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,063
Yes, sir.

123
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:17,946
Yes, sir. Right away.

124
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:23,531
Mr. Stackhouse needs
to see you in Maintenance.

125
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:27,869
I'll hold your stuff.

126
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,829
He said it shouldn't take long.

127
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:31,956
Okay.

128
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,334
A guard says he found them
in the Back Half rec yard.

129
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,087
I thought no one ever goes back there.

130
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,739
Mostly they don't.

131
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:07,367
What if one of the kids had found them?

132
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,093
Kids back there
are hardly in finding shape.

133
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,113
I want to know who signed them
out of Maintenance.

134
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,264
There must be a record.

135
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,432
There is.

136
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:21,230
And it doesn't interest you
which of our employees

137
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,398
is capable of this level
of carelessness?

138
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,009
Why? So, you can fire them?

139
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,278
Julia, you can't complain
about a staffing shortage

140
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,114
and then try to fire
the people you do have

141
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,329
over every little thing.

142
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,144
What happened to you?

143
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:38,331
- Excuse me?
- There was a time

144
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,949
you never would have tolerated
this kind of breach.

145
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:43,586
If you're unhappy with my performance,

146
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,297
you can suggest our employers let me go.

147
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:48,991
You hate they gave me this place.

148
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,636
Don't you?

149
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:54,596
Passed over for a girl you trained.

150
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,349
Passed over for a girl.

151
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,601
Our employers, in their wisdom,

152
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:03,314
decided we were best served with
an administrator at the helm.

153
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,758
Not my place to question it.

154
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,929
Your jealousy's
making you sloppy, Trevor.

155
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:16,269
Is there something
you wanted to say, Julia?

156
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,956
Was it Dr. Hendricks?

157
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:25,294
I notice you two have been spending

158
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,114
a great deal of time together.

159
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:34,245
Find out who dropped
the fucking scissors.

160
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:36,852
I wanna talk to them.

161
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,773
Hi. This is Maureen Alvorson from...

162
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,408
Yes, that's right.

163
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,495
Um, you remember you said
if I ever wanted to talk?

164
00:18:57,954 --> 00:18:59,989
Well, I got a story that makes Watergate

165
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,598
look like a walk in the park.

166
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,834
Anyway, I've got
your source all ready to go.

167
00:19:04,473 --> 00:19:06,671
I was gonna bring him to you, but...

168
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:10,633
I'm afraid there's been
a change of plans.

169
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:11,634
Yeah.

170
00:19:12,426 --> 00:19:15,012
Looks like I may not make it outta here.

171
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:17,098
So...

172
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:20,338
I need you to meet him yourself,

173
00:19:20,977 --> 00:19:22,520
get him somewhere safe,

174
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:25,648
make sure the world hears his story.

175
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,443
It... then I'll let him cover all that.

176
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:31,696
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

177
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:37,509
He's expecting
to meet me at the Red Steps.

178
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,328
Can you get there?

179
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:43,749
Don't worry about a thing.

180
00:19:45,543 --> 00:19:47,461
You're a good person, Maureen.

181
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,090
Thanks.

182
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:07,080
Anyone with eyes on caretaker Alvorson,

183
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,983
she's wanted in Maintenance.

184
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:53,361
Are you okay?

185
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,237
You need some help?

186
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:57,338
Hey. Wait, wait. Whoa! Whoa!

187
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,074
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

188
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:00,618
- Stop! Stop! Don't...
- Okay.

189
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:02,077
- Don't come any closer.
- Okay.

190
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:04,747
Okay. Easy. Just take it easy.

191
00:21:07,124 --> 00:21:08,517
Are you with them?

192
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,587
Who? Am I with who?

193
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:14,965
It's okay, kid. I'm a cop, okay?

194
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:16,859
Well, I'm sort of a cop. My name's Tim.

195
00:21:16,952 --> 00:21:18,719
Who's done this to you?
Was it one of your parents?

196
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:19,845
No!

197
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,189
My parents are dead.

198
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:35,277
I'm sorry to hear that.

199
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,950
Look, I think you're telling the truth,

200
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,411
but I'm not strong enough to be sure.

201
00:21:43,786 --> 00:21:46,455
- Right.
- God, I wish Avery were here.

202
00:21:46,831 --> 00:21:48,165
Who's Avery?

203
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,586
Look, kid, you're pretty banged up.

204
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,321
We should probably get you
to a doctor or hospital.

205
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,315
No, no. No. I don't have time for that.

206
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,217
I need to get to a place
called the Red Steps.

207
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,360
Do you know it?

208
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:02,570
Why don't you have time for this?

209
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,405
- You're in trouble, huh?
- You're not listening to me.

210
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,058
I need to get to the Red Steps.

211
00:22:06,141 --> 00:22:08,978
You... You're not going
to believe me anyway.

212
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:13,082
- Why do you need to get to the Red Steps?
- Do you know it, man?

213
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:15,874
Hey, what are you...

214
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:21,188
Here. Take this.
You look like you're freezing.

215
00:22:23,991 --> 00:22:25,327
It's okay.

216
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:38,591
So, what's at the Red Steps?

217
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:41,685
I'm supposed to be meeting
someone there.

218
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,611
Uh-huh.

219
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:45,180
That's assuming Stackhouse
doesn't sniff her out first.

220
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:48,476
What? What'd you just say?

221
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,680
They... They watch
their staff all the time.

222
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,830
They're paranoid about leaks.

223
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,316
No, the name.

224
00:22:55,524 --> 00:22:57,693
What name did you just say?

225
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:01,030
Stackhouse.

226
00:23:01,905 --> 00:23:03,699
He's the head of security.

227
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:06,744
Okay.

228
00:23:09,205 --> 00:23:10,430
Here's what's gonna happen.

229
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:11,832
We are gonna hike back up to my car.

230
00:23:11,915 --> 00:23:13,099
It's not far from the Red Steps.

231
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,559
I will have cell reception there,

232
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,545
and you can tell me
everything on the way.

233
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:19,381
You're gonna tell me
your whole story, okay?

234
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,259
You're never gonna believe me, you know?

235
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:25,888
You'd be surprised what I might believe.

236
00:23:26,764 --> 00:23:28,557
Come on. Come on.

237
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:42,926
Someone fucking get me Maureen.

238
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:06,929
Sigsby?

239
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,725
I suppose that makes sense.

240
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:15,244
She made a call a few minutes ago,

241
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,572
said she wasn't
gonna make it out of here.

242
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:18,915
A call?

243
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,376
She thought she was talking
to a journalist.

244
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,795
Fortunately,
for our short-term survival,

245
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,739
she called my journalist.

246
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:30,077
- You're welcome, by the way.
- She was leaking.

247
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,829
She was doing more than that.

248
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,708
She told my agent she'd
just helped a kid escape.

249
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,101
- Impossible.
- Exactly.

250
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,879
She was delusional.

251
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:56,103
Zeke, I need, um, a locater check.

252
00:24:56,186 --> 00:24:56,996
On who?

253
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:59,064
I already looked. They're all here.

254
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:01,108
- All of them.
- What?

255
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:02,500
Just do it.

256
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,237
I'm telling you,
I've been through all of this.

257
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,508
Full house.

258
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:12,093
Twenty-eight locaters in Back
Half, including Gorky Park.

259
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,263
Three in Front Half,
one in the cafeteria,

260
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,748
and the other in their rooms.

261
00:25:17,154 --> 00:25:19,977
Yeah. I need visual confirmation.

262
00:25:20,044 --> 00:25:22,171
Are you serious?
First order of business,

263
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,881
get someone in here, cut down...

264
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:25,356
- Joanne?
- Go ahead.

265
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,150
Joanne, I need a physical head count.

266
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,802
- Okay. Got it.
- Gorks too.

267
00:25:29,011 --> 00:25:30,179
Stand by.

268
00:25:32,905 --> 00:25:34,600
We're checking Front Half ourselves.

269
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:37,978
Close the door.

270
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,567
Telekinesis? That's like...

271
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:45,944
that's like the power
to move shit with your mind?

272
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:47,821
I told you you wouldn't believe me.

273
00:25:47,905 --> 00:25:49,505
Yeah, you get that from inside my head?

274
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,258
Well, I don't need to
if it's on your face.

275
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,884
But you can read my mind?

276
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,170
Sort of. I'm not very good at it.

277
00:25:55,195 --> 00:25:56,220
Mm-hmm.

278
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,182
I can't get real words, really.
Just feelings.

279
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,516
I know how it sounds.

280
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,170
You think I'm having
some sort of break with reality

281
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:05,647
or maybe the beginnings
of schizophrenia.

282
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:07,065
Don't worry. It's what I'd think.

283
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,067
I didn't say that.
I know Stackhouse is real.

284
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,804
The rest of it is a little weird.

285
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,364
What is that?

286
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,282
It's a flash drive.

287
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,851
I know it's a flash drive. What's on it?

288
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:19,061
No idea.

289
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,980
Maureen gave it to me "in case."

290
00:26:22,773 --> 00:26:25,083
You wouldn't happen to have
a laptop on you, would you?

291
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,402
Maureen. She's the housekeeper,
orderly, whatever you said?

292
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,738
- Yeah.
- You meet her and then what?

293
00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:32,992
She takes me to talk to a reporter...

294
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,579
who'll probably think
I'm as crazy as you do.

295
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,999
I didn't say that.

296
00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:49,967
Subject Benson, confirmed.

297
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:13,198
Joanne for Sigsby.

298
00:27:13,282 --> 00:27:14,575
Go for Sigsby.

299
00:27:14,638 --> 00:27:16,009
We're full up Back Here.

300
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,995
Visual confirmation on 28 out of 28.

301
00:27:18,078 --> 00:27:19,121
One to go.

302
00:27:23,072 --> 00:27:26,311
Zeke, where exactly is the
locater on subject Ellis?

303
00:27:26,503 --> 00:27:27,921
What do you mean, ma'am?

304
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:29,832
I'm showing him directly
in front of you.

305
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,467
Range less than two meters.

306
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:50,686
Come here.
I wanna take a look at your ear.

307
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,604
Uh, that can wait.

308
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,172
I mean, we should really keep moving.

309
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,699
The wound is wide open.

310
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:57,633
Last thing you need's
it getting infected.

311
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,244
Who knows what's in that river.

312
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,851
You've got signal?
Come on. Look up my name.

313
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,254
- Luke Ellis, Minneapolis.
- Yes. I will. I will.

314
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:03,892
I'm really sorry, Luke.

315
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:11,808
Minneapolis PD says that
you're a person of interest.

316
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,278
Of course I am.

317
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,489
God. These fucking people.

318
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:20,050
What? So, person of interest, what?

319
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,564
So, you're supposed
to detain me now, hmm?

320
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,959
<i>- Chief Ashworth.</i>
- Chief? Yeah, it's Tim.

321
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:29,710
I've got an emergency here.
I got a kid who said... Chief?

322
00:29:32,385 --> 00:29:33,730
- Fuck.
- What happened?

323
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,174
The call must've dropped.

324
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:37,342
Signal's gone.

325
00:29:37,968 --> 00:29:40,470
It's weird 'cause we've
got line-of-sight here.

326
00:29:41,305 --> 00:29:42,347
It's them.

327
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:44,407
- What?
- It's them. They know I'm gone.

328
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,018
We gotta warn Maureen.

329
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:48,077
Tim! How far to the Red Steps?

330
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,287
You don't really expect me
to take you down there

331
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,496
just the two of us.
We need to go find...

332
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,706
Fine. I'll go myself!

333
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,709
Will you wait, please?
I believe you, okay?

334
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,379
I believe your story.
All I wanna do is help you.

335
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,880
So if you can read minds,

336
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:03,035
look into mine and you'll see
I'm telling you the truth.

337
00:30:09,364 --> 00:30:11,084
You don't really believe me,

338
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,046
not about all of it, but...

339
00:30:16,044 --> 00:30:17,508
you do want to help.

340
00:30:18,804 --> 00:30:20,010
That's fair.

341
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:24,932
Then the best thing
you can do for me right now

342
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,810
is just help me find Maureen.

343
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:30,137
'Kay, if I'm making it all up,

344
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,022
there'll be no one out there anyway.

345
00:30:33,023 --> 00:30:34,024
Hmm?

346
00:30:36,977 --> 00:30:39,112
Fine. Ear first.

347
00:30:44,855 --> 00:30:47,483
Hurry up, man. She's got
a load in her drawers.

348
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:03,382
I'm guessing she goes up the chimney?

349
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,235
As opposed to what? A proper burial?

350
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,492
Where do we keep her till then?

351
00:31:08,642 --> 00:31:10,311
The Security Office.

352
00:31:11,061 --> 00:31:12,938
And not a word of this to anyone.

353
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:14,523
'Course not, ma'am.

354
00:31:29,705 --> 00:31:31,206
You gonna call him?

355
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:33,075
You know there's not a world

356
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,711
in which this falls on only one of us.

357
00:31:36,003 --> 00:31:38,213
First escape in 70 years.

358
00:31:38,422 --> 00:31:42,400
Understood. Plenty of blame
to spread around.

359
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,878
And the second I pick up that phone,

360
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,130
we're both going up
in the chimney with Maureen.

361
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,391
Of course there's a chance,

362
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:52,644
if we bring the boy back quickly enough,

363
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:54,829
we never have to make the call.

364
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,523
If we bring him back alive.

365
00:31:56,786 --> 00:32:00,877
My asset has orders not to damage him
more than necessary.

366
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,754
- Can she handle that?
- A 14-year-old boy?

367
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,464
I'd think so.

368
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,909
I'm about to take a team to back her up.

369
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:10,386
I'll do it.

370
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,914
Julia, this is a field operation.

371
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,042
It hasn't been that long.

372
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,061
And I need you here anyway
to hold down the fort

373
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,424
in case the kids have
some other thing planned.

374
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,635
Just remember, you said it yourself.

375
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:30,432
There's no version of this
where only one of us goes down.

376
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,978
And I know whose head'll come off first

377
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,606
and roll the farthest.

378
00:32:51,215 --> 00:32:52,763
Hey, hang back a sec.

379
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:54,831
I'm gonna go scope it out.

380
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:57,725
If anything happens,
you make your way to Dennison

381
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,977
and you talk to Chief John Ashworth.

382
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,338
He will help you, okay?

383
00:33:02,506 --> 00:33:03,731
You got me?

384
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:04,966
Yeah, okay.

385
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,554
Stay there.

386
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,566
Fuck this.

387
00:33:29,473 --> 00:33:30,784
Maureen?

388
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:36,498
Holy shit.

389
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,852
Kate the Great.

390
00:33:41,878 --> 00:33:42,979
Hey!

391
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,439
It's you.

392
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,508
It's me.

393
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,222
What are you doing out here?

394
00:33:53,056 --> 00:33:54,850
You said, "Maureen," right?

395
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,644
You're here looking for Maureen?

396
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,539
Well, she sent me.

397
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:03,875
So, I guess that means
you've seen the boy.

398
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,101
What boy?

399
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,714
I just told you: Maureen
sent me here to meet a boy.

400
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,508
She said that she just helped him

401
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,300
escape from the place she works,

402
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,036
wants me to help him blow the whistle.

403
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:18,264
On the... sasquatch breeding?

404
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,125
To be honest, I...

405
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:23,352
thought she'd lost it completely,

406
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,354
that I'd come out here
and not find shit.

407
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:28,592
But then you show up,
asking for Maureen.

408
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:32,429
Hey!

409
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,863
Maureen sent me! I'm a reporter.

410
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,617
She wants me to tell your story.
Did she tell you that?

411
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:45,317
She did, actually.

412
00:34:45,946 --> 00:34:47,465
She's telling the truth.

413
00:34:49,513 --> 00:34:50,906
I'm Kate.

414
00:34:51,907 --> 00:34:53,783
Maureen never told me your name.

415
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:57,136
Luke.

416
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,831
Luke. Pleased to meet you.

417
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:02,558
Okay, first order of business,

418
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,336
we gotta get you somewhere safe.

419
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:07,088
Now, you're hiding something.

420
00:35:08,131 --> 00:35:09,382
You're shielding.

421
00:35:10,682 --> 00:35:11,717
What?

422
00:35:11,968 --> 00:35:15,054
You were telling the truth... before.

423
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:17,014
About Maureen?

424
00:35:20,435 --> 00:35:21,894
Something's changed.

425
00:35:22,312 --> 00:35:24,481
Okay, someone's gonna
need to catch me up here.

426
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:26,248
The kid says he's able to...

427
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,613
Your, uh...

428
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:33,240
Your phone works out here?

429
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:35,866
Yeah.

430
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:37,410
Stackhouse.

431
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:39,404
She knows Stackhouse!

432
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,247
She's one of them!

433
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:41,665
Jeez, kid.

434
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:43,709
Where's the fire?

435
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:45,168
Relax.

436
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:46,728
It's okay. Just...

437
00:35:47,796 --> 00:35:49,980
Whoa. Easy, easy.

438
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,717
Nothing personal.
Wrong place, wrong time.

439
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,779
Oh...

440
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:26,794
Fuck.

441
00:36:27,043 --> 00:36:28,837
Well, I guess they got Maureen.

442
00:36:31,215 --> 00:36:34,467
But why only send one to intercept me?

443
00:36:37,398 --> 00:36:39,973
What was that thing
with the, uh... the tree?

444
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:41,475
That was you?

445
00:36:41,938 --> 00:36:43,560
- Huh?
- Yes.

446
00:36:50,592 --> 00:36:53,320
Right. All right, we gotta go.
Let's move.

447
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:04,497
We should look for a big city.

448
00:37:05,215 --> 00:37:07,834
With an FBI office and...

449
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,046
and a TV station.

450
00:37:10,206 --> 00:37:11,630
Luke, somebody died.

451
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,673
Okay?

452
00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:15,417
We gotta go to the police,
we gotta find Chief Ashworth.

453
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,594
Except that woman shot at you!

454
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,263
Yeah, Kate.

455
00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:24,810
Clearly, the Institute's

456
00:37:24,893 --> 00:37:27,187
got agents embedded
into the local population.

457
00:37:27,271 --> 00:37:28,973
So, don't you think the Chief...

458
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,456
The Chief is not dirty.

459
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:32,124
Okay, and I bet you would've
said the same about

460
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,751
Kate the Great before
she tried to kill you.

461
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,404
I met her one time.
The Chief, I know. He's solid.

462
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,282
Look into my mind
if you don't believe me.

463
00:37:39,783 --> 00:37:42,384
Looking in your mind doesn't
tell me whether it's true;

464
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,746
it just tells me if you believe it.

465
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:47,248
Mm-hmm.

466
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:50,572
So, the Chief?

467
00:37:51,233 --> 00:37:52,913
You're sure we can trust him?

468
00:37:53,907 --> 00:37:56,451
- You're ready to die on that hill?
- We can trust him.

469
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:58,301
Sure hope you're right.

470
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,221
Otherwise...

471
00:38:01,596 --> 00:38:03,556
we both die on that hill.

472
00:38:21,185 --> 00:38:22,801
They found the asset's vehicle.

473
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,844
It's back in the woods
on the North side.

474
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,205
- Any sign of her?
- Not so far.

475
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,214
<i>Stackhouse.</i>

476
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:04,926
Yeah. Turns out your reporter
wasn't up to it after all.

477
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:30,031
Doctor. A word.

478
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,291
Uh, yeah, a word... a word about...?

479
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,749
Ms. Sigsby.

480
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,793
Ms. Sigsby. Uh, Jesus!

481
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,754
I, you know, I... this...

482
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,841
How 'bout this?

483
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,259
The two of you can have each other.

484
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,220
- Just leave me out of it.
- You're babbling.

485
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:53,432
You know we have
two kids left in Front Half?

486
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:57,895
Two! You have any idea
what happens when we run out?

487
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:01,591
No more conveyor belt,
no more replacing conductors.

488
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:05,444
Every keyhole brings us
one step closer to the end.

489
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,447
These are long-view problems.

490
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:10,016
Yeah, not... not too long.

491
00:40:10,517 --> 00:40:12,815
The rate we've been
going through keyholes,

492
00:40:12,816 --> 00:40:15,663
I guess it depends
how you define "long".

493
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,916
It's why the first thing
in every lab report

494
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,375
is to define your terms.

495
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,380
At the moment,
I'd call a long-view problem

496
00:40:23,613 --> 00:40:27,050
anything that doesn't relate
to us surviving the day.

497
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:29,468
Why wouldn't we survive the day?

498
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,678
Your lady friend is out there right now,

499
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,556
trying to make herself
the hero of this mess,

500
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,380
so she can hang it around our necks.

501
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:40,312
Not mine! I'm not... due respect,

502
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,064
I'm not in charge of security.

503
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,900
Do you really think the Committee

504
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,568
will put this down
to a security failure?

505
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,363
After Harry Cross...

506
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,181
and the twins?

507
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,282
You've seen how they operate.

508
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,495
They'll decide this place has
a culture of mismanagement.

509
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:59,957
Means either you replace the head coach

510
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,443
or her assistants.

511
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:03,753
She wouldn't...

512
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:07,907
Of course she would.
So would you. So would I.

513
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,883
When it comes down to it,

514
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,537
there's no limit
to what you'll do to survive.

515
00:41:13,746 --> 00:41:16,583
So, what do you propose?

516
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,002
When the time comes,

517
00:41:19,027 --> 00:41:22,755
you back whatever story I tell.

518
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,510
We present ourselves as the fix

519
00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:29,888
for Sigsby's culture.

520
00:41:30,138 --> 00:41:31,114
Yeah.

521
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:32,432
Right the ship.

522
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,244
And if we're in charge,
there'll be no one to snitch

523
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,955
to Upstairs about us
trying to develop a PC...

524
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,373
Long-view problems, Doctor.

525
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,749
Short-term, yes.

526
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,988
For now, let's just try to see tomorrow.

527
00:41:56,994 --> 00:41:59,016
Well, that's exactly
my predicament, Chief.

528
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,852
Mr. Hollister, I'm a little busy

529
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,154
policing a whole town
without any communication.

530
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:03,463
Chief!

531
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:06,466
Chief, this boy needs help.

532
00:42:06,716 --> 00:42:08,067
Sit down.

533
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,848
What happened to him?

534
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,282
Who is he?

535
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,185
Luke Ellis, Chief John Ashworth.

536
00:42:22,782 --> 00:42:25,001
Tim, this boy needs
some real medical help.

537
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,528
I know, but first, you need
to hear what he's got to say.

538
00:42:28,571 --> 00:42:29,989
I'll get the doc.

539
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,783
That'd be great, Norbert.

540
00:42:31,808 --> 00:42:33,936
Thanks, Mr. Hollister. Here.

541
00:42:38,242 --> 00:42:40,266
Someone's gonna need
to start filling me in.

542
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,184
The kid's got a flash drive.

543
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,003
Says it'll help back up his story.

544
00:42:44,587 --> 00:42:46,506
What is his story?

545
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,776
You're better off, uh,

546
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,402
looking at the flash drive first.

547
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,695
It'll save time.

548
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,181
Why? What's on it?

549
00:42:55,598 --> 00:42:57,100
I don't know.

550
00:42:59,157 --> 00:43:00,812
Chief, please.

551
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,648
Trust me.

552
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:09,904
It's okay.

553
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,719
So?

554
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:34,595
Some kind of video.

555
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,268
I have eyes on the boy.

556
00:43:46,225 --> 00:43:48,443
Well, I guess we better watch it.

557
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,782
